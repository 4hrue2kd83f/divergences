  je_hungarian_crisis_old: "The Hungarian Crisis"
  je_hungarian_crisis_old_reason: "Burgundian, Scandinavian, be Imperial diplomats have all been meeting with the Foreign Minister regarding a monstrous political snarl. The trouble originated with the conservative Catholic Duke of Nitra, who rallied dissatisfied Hungarian magnates to recognize Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund V as King of Hungary and encouraged him to depose Hungary's liberal Protestant king. This is a direct breach of Article XVIII (annulling the Jagiellon claim to Hungary) of the Treaty of Paris which ended the devastating Great German War in 1820. Burgundy and Scandinavia have become apoplectic at the notion of Sigismund breaking the Treaty and seizing Hungary, and are mobilizing for war against the Empire. \n\nHungarian Power: #variable [Country.MakeScope.Var('dvg_hungarian_crisis_old_hun_power').GetValue|+=]#!\nPommeranian Power: #variable [Country.MakeScope.Var('dvg_hungarian_crisis_old_pom_power').GetValue|+=]#!\n"
