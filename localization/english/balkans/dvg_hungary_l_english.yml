  dvg_hungary.1.t: "The State of the Lands of the Szent Korona"
  dvg_hungary.1.d: "The Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen were a battleground between the Jagiellons and the Turks for centuries. Transylvanian Prince Janos II Kemény, descended from the great Hunyadis, was briefly the king of Hungary, Moldavia, and Wallachia in the seventeenth century, but was defeated by simultaneous attacks from the Empire, Poland, and the Turks. The Great Turkish War of the 18th century and the [concept_dvg_german_revolution] decades later allowed us to eventually oust both powers and win our freedom."
  dvg_hungary.1.f: "Now we find ourselves within an interregnum, with Prince Krisztofer Kemény of Transylvania the leading candidate. However he is a liberal, half-Rumanian Protestant, and unpopular outside of his homeland. Article XVIII of the [concept_dvg_treaty_of_paris] forbids any Jagiellon from ruling Hungary, yet they refuse to return the Szent Korona, vital to Magyar kingship. With our borders temporarily secure, the eastern Protestant and western Catholic magnates are bickering over whether to support Krisztofer or search for someone else."
  dvg_hungary.1.a: "Atoning sorrow hath weighed down sins of past and future days…"

  dvg_hungary.2.t: "Tensions in Nitra"
  dvg_hungary.2.d: "Some western magnates have begun to begrudgingly accept that Krisztofer's pedigree and personal charisma make him the best choice for the throne. Others have not."
  dvg_hungary.2.f: "One holdout in particular is Duke Gábor IV Zápolya of Nitra, a fiery Catholic zealot of Croatian and Moravian blood whose ancestors fought under the Papal banner in the anti-Hussite crusades. Gábor, denouncing Krisztofer's lack of the Szent Korona and “failure to reclaim” Turkish-held Temesköz, demands that Emperor Sigismund V be crowned instead! This is despite the [concept_dvg_treaty_of_paris] explicitly forbidding a Jagiellon to rule Hungary, not to mention the fact that we are in no condition to attack the Turks…and yet, Sigismund holds both a claim and the Szent Korona. Hungarian law states that the crown itself is a legal person identical to the state of Hungary and superior to the ruling monarch, who rules "in the name of the crown.” No king is truly legitimate without it - yet enthroning the Emperor would create an international catastrophe and would spark a war beyond reckoning."
  dvg_hungary.2.a: "Krisztofer is the rightful king, even if the Szent Korona is in Prague!"

  dvg_hungary.3.t: "The King of the Hungarian Nation"
  dvg_hungary.3.d: "Duke Gabor IV's scheme to install Emperor Sigismund V as King of Hungary forced our hand. We could no longer wait for the return of the Szent Korona."
  dvg_hungary.3.f: "The House of Kemény thus convinced a bare minimum quorum of magnates to support Krisztofer's kingship through bribery and blackmail. To that end, an emergency meeting of the Hungarian Diet was convened in Buda, where, in a solemn ceremony, Prince Krisztofer Kemény of Transylvania was acclaimed “King of the Hungarian Nation,” an archaic but technically sufficient title. This is a temporary measure to award him sorely needed legitimacy until the Szent Korona is returned and he can be properly coronated. Unfortunately, this desperate act has allowed the Duke of Nitra to rally Catholic magnates to his cause by denouncing the procedure as a sham and the new King Krisztofer to be illegitimate. All of Upper Hungary is now awash with reaction, especially among the magnates who refused to attend the Diet."
  dvg_hungary.3.a: "Long live the TRUE king!"

  dvg_hungary.4.t: "The Nitran Conspiracy"
  dvg_hungary.4.d: "Duke Gabor IV's insubordination has increased in scope. He is now believed to be recruiting support among the western and northern magnates, as well as the Catholic clergy, to contest King Krisztofer's legitimacy."
  dvg_hungary.4.f: "While ordinarily we would arrest him for treason against the monarch, our nation is barely keeping together as it is, and attempting to imprison a duke so popular with the Catholic clergy and the nobility could ignite a civil war. Therefore we are doing our best to keep an eye on the Duke. As of late he has been hosting guests from all over the Catholic regions of Hungary - we presume that he is building support to contest the King's rule. We cannot be certain of how many of his acquaintances have agreed to join his cause, but the possibility of insurrection at least in Upper Hungary in the near future must be considered."
  dvg_hungary.4.a: "Duke Gabor brings shame to the House of Zápolya!"

  dvg_hungary.5.t: "The Hungarian Crisis"
  dvg_hungary.5.d: "The House of Jagiellon claimed the Kingdom of Hungary ever since it slipped from our grasp in the 15th century. We made various attempts to reclaim it, but Article XVIII of the [concept_dvg_treaty_of_paris], which ended the wars of the [concept_dvg_german_revolution], forbade any Jagiellon to rule Hungary."
  dvg_hungary.5.f: "Now it appears that the matter may be reignited. Duke Gábor IV Zápolya of Nitra is a fervent Catholic who despises the current King, Krisztofer Kemény (descendant of Janos II Kemény who briefly ruled Hungary, Moldavia, and Wallachia). Krisztofer is a liberal, half-Rumanian Protestant from Transylvania, and thus quite controversial. Furthermore, it is we, not Krisztofer, who hold the Holy Crown of Hungary, without which no man can legally rule the kingdom. Krisztofer was forced to take the title of “King of the Hungarian Nation” just to claim any form of legitimacy. It is well-known that the Duke, who is himself part Moravian, admires Sigismund and wishes that he would rule Hungary. Yet such a blatant violation of the Treaty of Paris could ignite an international crisis."
  dvg_hungary.5.a: "Let us hope, then, that they are simply rumors…"

  dvg_hungary.6.t: "The Rogue Diet of Nitra"
  dvg_hungary.6.d: "Duke Gabor IV has decided to act. It is now clear that he was indeed recruiting conspirators for a plot against the monarchy, a conspiracy which has moved into action in Nitra City. There, Hungarian magnates and bishops from across the Catholic heartland have convened to hold an illegal and unrecognized Diet."
  dvg_hungary.6.f: "At this meeting, the Duke and his conspirators first declared Krisztofer's acclamation as “King of the Hungarian Nation” to be legally meaningless, and then recognized Emperor Sigismund V as King of Hungary! We were unable to prevent word of this supreme treason from reaching Prague, and are now preparing for the worst. Martial law has been declared across Upper Hungary, and we must prepare for the possibility of civil war or even an invasion by the Holy Roman Empire to place its ruler upon our throne."
  dvg_hungary.6.a: "Judas!"

  dvg_hungary.7.t: "The Prague Conference"
  dvg_hungary.7.d: "For Generations Bohemia has claimed to be the rightful owner of Hungary despite the [concept_dvg_treaty_of_paris] explicitly forbidding it. Now a small but influential group of Nobles in Hungary have declared the Bohemian King ruler of Hungary. In a desperate attempt to save himself the Hungarian King seeked help from Burgundy to prevent beeing overthrown. Bohemian troops where allready on their way when news reached the rest of europe. In a last second effort Burgundian intervention prevented Bohemia from seizing Hungary. The large nations of Europe have now been invited to Prague to resolve this issue."
  dvg_hungary.7.f: "The city of Prague was selected as the place of the conference by Burgundy. Defeating Bohemia in their own Capital would be highly humuliating."
  dvg_hungary.7.a: "To Prague"

  dvg_hungary.8.t: "The Hungarian Vote - Hungarian Independece"
  dvg_hungary.8.d: "The votes have been assest and the Result is majority for Hungarian Independence. The Burgundian delegates seem relieved by the outcome while our delegates are furious. Now everyone awaits our response. We shall..."

  dvg_hungary.9.f: "Victory in Prague!"
  dvg_hungary.9.a: "Accept the Outcome"

  dvg_hungary.10.t: "The Hungarian Vote - Hungarian Subject"
  dvg_hungary.10.d: "The votes have been assest and the Result is majority for Hungarian submission. The Burgundian delegates seem furious by the outcome while our delegates are estatic. Now everyone awaits our response. "
  dvg_hungary.10.f: "Victory in Prague!"

  dvg_hungary.12.d: "“Article I. The High Contracting Parties recognize His Majesty the Emperor of the Germans and King of Bohemia Sigismund the Fifth of the House of Jagiellon as the King of Hungary…”"
  dvg_hungary.12.f: "In a stunning turn of events which none but the Imperial delegation predicted, the Congress has chosen to confirm their Hungarian claim! As soon as word was received in Prague, their armies crossed the border to link up with the anti-Kemény forces led by Duke Gabor of Nitra and march on Buda. Krisztofer Kemény's loyalists were soon routed, and in a lavish ceremony, Sigismund was crowned King of Hungary. All of Europe is in shock at this unprecedented diplomatic victory, but now, we rejoice! #R Though word is spreading of agitation by Keménist loyalists in the dynasty's homeland of Transylvania… #!"

  dvg_hungary.13.f: "The Congress has chosen to uphold Hungary's independence and its ruling Kemény dynasty! Duke Gabor of Nitra's assembly has been deemed illegal and invalid, and Bohemias claim to the throne is once again forfeit. Thei efforts to transgress the Treaty of Paris have only further decreased their reputation across Europe."
  dvg_hungary.13.a: "The Emperor will be most displeased"

  dvg_hungary.14.t: "War for Hungary"
  dvg_hungary.14.d: "Unable to resolve the Hungarian Crisis peacefully war has broken out between Bohemia and Burgundy. Supported by the nations of the conference this conflict could spiral to another great war."
