  je_hungarian_crisis: "The Hungarian crisis"

  dvg_hungary.1.t: "The State of the Lands of the Szent Korona (Holy Crown)"
  dvg_hungary.1.d: "The Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen were a battleground between the Jagiellons and the Turks for centuries. Transylvanian Prince Janos II Kemény, descended from the great Hunyadis, was briefly the king of Hungary, Moldavia, and Wallachia in the seventeenth century, but was defeated by simultaneous attacks from the Empire, Poland, and the Turks. The Great Turkish War of the eighteenth century and the Great German War decades later allowed us to eventually oust both powers and win our freedom. Now we find ourselves within an interregnum, with Prince Krisztofer Kemény of Transylvania the leading candidate. However he is a liberal, half-Rumanian Protestant, and unpopular outside of his homeland."
  dvg_hungary.1.f: "Article XVIII of the Treaty of Paris forbids any Jagiellon from ruling Hungary, yet they refuse to return the Szent Korona, vital to Magyar kingship. With our borders temporarily secure, the eastern Protestant and western Catholic magnates are bickering over whether to support Krisztofer or search for someone else."

# Hungarian Crisis #
  dvg_hun_crisis.1.t: "Tensions in Nitra"
  dvg_hun_crisis.1.d: "Some western magnates have begun to begrudgingly accept that Krisztofer's pedigree and personal charisma make him the best choice for the throne. Others have not."
  dvg_hun_crisis.1.f: "One holdout in particular is Duke Gábor IV Zápolya of Nitra, a fiery Catholic zealot of Croatian and Moravian blood whose ancestors fought under the Papal banner in the anti-Hussite crusades. Gábor, denouncing Krisztofer's lack of the Szent Korona and “failure to reclaim” Turkish-held Temesköz, demands that Emperor Sigismund V be crowned instead! This is despite the Treaty of Paris explicitly forbidding a Jagiellon to rule Hungary, not to mention the fact that we are in no condition to attack the Turks…and yet, Sigismund holds both a claim and the Szent Korona. Hungarian law states that the crown itself is a legal person identical to the state of Hungary and superior to the ruling monarch, who rules "in the name of the crown.” No king is truly legitimate without it - yet enthroning the Emperor would create an international catastrophe and would spark a war beyond reckoning."
  dvg_hun_crisis.1.a: "Krisztofer is the rightful king, even if the Szent Korona is in Prague!"
