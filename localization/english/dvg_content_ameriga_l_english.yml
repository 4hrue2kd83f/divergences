 concept_dvg_ameriga: "Ameriga"
 concept_dvg_ameriga_desc: "Discovered in the 15th Century by Florentian explorer Amerigo Vespuccio, Ameriga is a vast and diverse continent which has seen many conflicts over the ages. While the east of the continent has had its demographic makeup radically altered by European settlers, who brought with them foreign diseases and established colonial states which killed off much of the native population, the west remains under the domain of the indigenous Incan Empire."
 concept_dvg_de_herrera: "José de Herrera"
 concept_dvg_de_herrera_desc: "Known as the 'great liberator', José de Herrera was a republican revolutionary who proclaimed the independence of Granada in 1829, kicking off a conflict which escalated into the [concept_dvg_fifth_andine_war], during which he was killed in action by soldiers from the Incan Empire. Despite his untimely death, he is upheld by many in [concept_dvg_ameriga] as a hero, and his political ideas form the basis of Herrerist thought."
 concept_dvg_fifth_andine_war: "Fifth Andine War"
 concept_dvg_fifth_andine_war_desc: "The Fifth Andine War was a conflict between the Incans and the Spanish lasting between 1829 and 1832. After Granadan revolutionary [concept_dvg_de_herrera] declared independence and expelled the Spanish garrisons, his forces marched south from Quito and began an assault on the Incans, resulting in the Siege of [concept_dvg_cuzco] which saw the imperial capital pillaged and defiled. Ultimately, the Incans managed to push back the invaders after de Herrera was killed in action, disorganizing the Granadan forces, but they were unable to reclaim the north, which fell under the dominion of [concept_dvg_chimu] lord Dom Túpac who returned the area to Spanish control."
