 concept_dvg_ameriga: "Ameriga"
 concept_dvg_ameriga_desc: "Discovered in the 15th Century by Florentian explorer Amerigo Vespuccio, Ameriga is a vast and diverse continent which has seen many conflicts.\n\nWhile the east of the continent has had its demographic makeup radically altered by European settlers, who brought with them foreign diseases, established colonial states, and introduced the Atlantic slave trade, the west remains under the domain of the indigenous Incan Empire."
 concept_dvg_spanish_empire: "Spanish Empire"
 concept_dvg_spanish_empire_desc: "Formed from the union of the crowns of Portugal and Castille in the 16th Century, the Spanish Empire is a globe-spanning entity known for its prestigious aristocratic culture and militant spread of Catholicism.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the Reconquista, which saw the annexation of the last Muslim states in the Iberian peninsula, the Spanish Crown began to fund the expeditions of explorers and conquistadors such as Christopher Columbus and [concept_dvg_francisco_pizarro], discovering the continents of [concept_dvg_ameriga] and Arcadia and establishing the first European colonies in the so-called New World."
 concept_dvg_planteur: "Planteurs"
 concept_dvg_planteur_desc: "Planteurs are an aristocratic class in the Francophone New World descended from colonial nobility. Basing their livelihoods and social relations on agrarian export economies, Planteurs are staunch defenders of slavery and oligarchy, hoping to preserve their traditional privileges."
 concept_dvg_jesuit: "Jesuits"
 concept_dvg_jesuit_desc: "The Jesuit Order, officially the 'Society of Jesus', is a missionary organization established to assist in the Spanish colonization of Ameriga and Arcadia by converting the indigenous population to Catholicism.\n\nAfter several failed ventures at preaching the Roman dogma, many of which resulted in the priests being killed by their would-be converts, the Jesuits began to adopt policies of Catholic Multiculturalism, learning native languages and operating within the cosmologies of the peoples they worked with, going on to experience far more success. The most prosperous of Jesuit colonies are those established along with the Tupi peoples of Equinoxea, as well as the Algonquians of northern Plantagenia."
 concept_dvg_anglo_lotharian: "Anglo-Lotharian"
 concept_dvg_anglo_lotharian_desc: "When Burgundian colonists first arrived on the River Plate basin, their dreams were of establishing a prosperous colony enriched by the silver trade flowing from the Incan Empire to the west. Yet the harsh environment of the Pampas and harrassment by [concept_dvg_anglois] corsairs quickly put an end to this illusion.\n\nYet rather than leasing their platine land to a company charter, the Burgundian Crown sought to kill two birds with one stone by encouraging the Anglican refugee population of the Netherlands, who frequently caused tensions with the locals and the neighboring Dual Monarchy, to settle the 'vast and fertile lands' of Southern Ameriga. After the Lotharian War of Independence, those of Anglo descent who remained in the new Francophone Republic became known as the Anglo-Lotharians, while those of radical sects and cultural purists travelled further south, founding the Kingdom of Beornia."
 concept_dvg_francisco_pizarro: "Francisco Pizarro"
 concept_dvg_francisco_pizarro_desc: "Francisco Pizarro was a Spanish conquistador from the 16th Century who tried and failed to conquer the Incan Empire, resulting in his death at the hands of an army led by [concept_dvg_ninan_cuyochi]."

 concept_dvg_ninan_cuyochi_desc: "Ninan Cuyochi was a [concept_dvg_sapa_inka] who ruled Tawantinsuyu in the 16th Century. After his father succumbed from European-borne diseases, Cuyochi isolated himself within the [concept_dvg_qurikancha], managing to survive the epidemics which killed many of his subjects. He would later lead an army against [concept_dvg_francisco_pizarro], repelling his invasion and ensuring the long-term survival of the Incan Empire."
 concept_dvg_francois_bart: "François Bart"
 concept_dvg_francois_bart_desc: "François Bart was a Burgundian corsair who lived in the 16th Century, famous for leading an expedition across the Strait of Magellan which resulted in first contact between the Incan Empire and the Burgundian Crown, establishing a long-standing alliance."
 concept_dvg_battle_of_quito: "Battle of Quito"
 concept_dvg_battle_of_quito_desc: "The Battle of Quito was a conflict between the Incans and the Spanish which occurred in 1603, the first large-scale engagement between the empires ever since the attempted invasion of [concept_dvg_francisco_pizarro].\n\nThough the Incan armies won the battle, surprising the Spanish with their mastery of firearms and cavalry acquired from Burgundy, the large amount of casualties they suffered resulted in an inconclusive peace treaty. The Incan-Spanish border was officially delimitated and Spanish missionaries gained access to the city of Quito, where they began to evangelize the [concept_dvg_chimu] people."
 concept_dvg_first_andine_war: "First Andine War"
 concept_dvg_first_andine_war_desc: "The First Andine War was a conflict between the Incans and the Spanish lasting between 1642 and 1647, considered by many historians as a consequence of the unresolved tensions remaining from the [concept_dvg_battle_of_quito].\n\nThe conflict began after a riot in Quito in which several Spanish missionaries were killed, accused of blasphemy towards [concept_dvg_inti]. Though the Spanish Armada had a decisive advantage in the early stages of the war, their assaults on the Burgundian Treasure Fleet, which was stationed on the port of Arica to trade with the Incans, resulted in the Burgundian Crown intervening and forcing the Spanish to sue for peace."
 concept_dvg_paullu_tupac_cuzi: "Paullu Tupac Cuzi"
 concept_dvg_paullu_tupac_cuzi_desc: "Paullu Tupac Cuzi was an [concept_dvg_inka] noble who became [concept_dvg_sapa_inka] in 1662, having secretly converted to Catholicism to secure Spanish support for his claim.\n\nAfter his religious affiliation was revealed publicly by the [concept_dvg_willaq_umu], a civil war ensued which split the empire in half. Though he was expelled from [concept_dvg_cuzco] by his rival [concept_dvg_poma_waman_amaru], Paullu managed to assume control over the [concept_dvg_chinchaysuyu] with the backing of the Catholic [concept_dvg_chimu] lords.\n\nUltimately, the war ended in a stalemate, with neither claimant being able to seize the other's domain. After his exclusion from Inkan centers of power, Paullu fostered close relations with European nobility, his lineage rising to a prestigious position within the [concept_dvg_spanish_empire] as the Dukes of Túpac-Cuzi."

 concept_dvg_poma_waman_amaru_desc: "Poma Waman Amaru was a [concept_dvg_sapa_inka] who ruled in the 17th Century, rising to the throne after [concept_dvg_paullu_tupac_cuzi] was ousted for his ties to the [concept_dvg_spanish_empire].\n\nAmaru's long reign is often considered the hallmark of the 'Andean Modern Age', with the empire hiring foreign specialists to develop its trade policy and improve the imperial examination system. Amaru also sought to increase state power over the [concept_dvg_qullasuyu] and the Pacific Coast, employing policies of economic and cultural integration meant to compensate for the loss of the [concept_dvg_chinchaysuyu].\n\nMost controversial during the Amaru Era was the project of 'Aimarization', through which the Incan state subjugated several formerly-autonomous [concept_dvg_ayllu] belonging to the Picunche and Diaguita peoples. This was done either via sponsored marriages into prestigious lineages favored by [concept_dvg_cuzco], or through forceful application of the [concept_dvg_mitma], resulting in the extinction of these groups."
 concept_dvg_incan_japanese_treaty: "Pacific Treaty"
 concept_dvg_incan_japanese_treaty_desc: "The Incan-Japanese Treaty of Friendship and Commerce was a pact signed in 1778 between the Incan and Japanese empires, which heralded an era of significant economic and cultural exchanges between both nations."

Ultimately, the Incans managed to push back the invaders after de Herrera was killed in action, disorganizing the Granadan forces, but they were unable to reclaim the north, which fell under the dominion of [concept_dvg_chimu] lord Dom Túpac who returned the area to Spanish control."
 concept_dvg_andino: "Andino"
 concept_dvg_andino_desc: "A catch-all term for those descended of mixed-race marriages between Europeans and Native Andean peoples, Andinos are most prevalent in the northern Andes, known to the Spanish as New Toledo and to the Incans as [concept_dvg_chinchaysuyu].\n\nIntermarriage played a crucial role in facilitating Spanish colonization, allowing conquistadors to build ties to prominent families and gain access to the language. Although they are excluded from metropolitan politics due to the casta system, many academics in Quito see the Andino as a 'cosmic race', mixing the perceived best qualities of Europeans and Andeans."
 concept_dvg_quechua: "Quechua"
 concept_dvg_quechua_desc: "The primary ethnic group of the Incan Empire, the Quechua are a native people of the central Andes, or the [concept_dvg_kuntisuyu]. Quechua families are organized into clans known as [concept_dvg_ayllu].\n\nThe highest of Quechua nobility are known as the [concept_dvg_inka], who hold a monopoly on political power in the empire. Most Quechua practice worship of [concept_dvg_inti], which originated in the Kingdom of [concept_dvg_cuzco], though some who live outside the empire have converted to Christianity."

Aimara families are organized into clans known as [concept_dvg_ayllu].\n\nPrior to the Incan conquest, the Aimara lived in lordships scattered across the Qullaw highlands. Though these lordships have in the past formed pan-regional states such as the Tiwanaku Empire, knowledge of these pre-Incan states is deliberately suppressed by the [concept_dvg_amauta] as part of imperial assimilation policies."
 concept_dvg_chimu: "Chimu"
 concept_dvg_chimu_desc: "Descended from the ancient Moche culture, the Chimu are a native people of the northern Andes, or the [concept_dvg_chinchaysuyu]. Distinct from the rest of the Andes, the former Kingdom of Chimor had a flourishing market economy, as well as a significant metalworking tradition.\n\nThough the Chimu once worshipped Quillapa Huillac, deity of the moon, the influence of Spanish missionaries has resulted in a majority of the population being converted to Catholicism. Due to this assimilation, some Chimu lords have managed to rise to prestigious positions within the [concept_dvg_spanish_empire]."
 concept_dvg_mapuche: "Mapuche"
 concept_dvg_mapuche_desc: "The Mapuche are a Native Amerigan ethnic group who inhabit the southern Andes and the region of Patagonia. Through fierce resistance as well as cultural and technological adaptations, the Mapuche have secured their independence for centuries against both Incan and European conquerors.\n\nThough they have in the past been a largely decentralized culture, led by regional Lonkos (chiefs), several parliaments between clans have been called in recent years, pushing for a national union of the lands of Wallmapu."
