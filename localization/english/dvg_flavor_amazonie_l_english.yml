 dvg_amazonie.1.d: "As of 1836, we are the only independent 'democracy' on the continent."
 dvg_amazonie.1.f: "However, even that notion is contested. While Amazonie does enable free elections to an extent, voting enfranchisement is largely wealth based and thus the Planteurs have had an almost oligarchic hold on the country's politics.
