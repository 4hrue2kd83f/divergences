 dvg_amazonie.1.t: "The Federation of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
 dvg_amazonie.1.d: "As of 1836, we are the only independent and recognized 'democratic' republic on the continent unlike our neighbors to the south and north."
 dvg_amazonie.1.f: "Yet, that notion is contested as the slavery debate rages on in the country. The western states of Equinoxea want to abolish slavery in all of the country, while most White Amazoniens in the east led by the Planteur class would rather see its practice continue and not give up their power. For now, a compromise has been made with the Equinoxiens being under our sovereignty but handling their own domestic affairs, abolising slavery and giving their Black populace citizenship within their jurisdiction. While Amazonie does enable free elections to an extent, voting enfranchisement is largely wealth based and thus the Planteurs have had an almost oligarchic hold on the country's politics. Still, it is thanks to them [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] managed to gain its independence peacefully, by paying off the Dual Monarchy with cash crops rather than go into armed conflict. "
 dvg_amazonie.1.a: "Good thing we're just a Republic, not a Democracy!"
 
 dvg_amazonie.2.t: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
 dvg_amazonie.2.d: "As of 1836, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] are able to grant universal suffrage, abolish slavery, and recognize citizenship regardless of race."
 dvg_amazonie.2.f: "This is in stark contrast with the rest of Amazonie which instead gives the Planteur class a near-oligarchic hold on politics and is also considerably wealthier. Currently, we are allowed to practice our own laws in autonomously thanks to the compromise reached with the Amazonien government. This compromise is not likely to last forever though, as the Equinoxean laws and ideals might threaten the Planteur grip on power should they spread across Amazonie. Respectively, many Equinoxiens also hope to abolish slavery and enfranchise all of the populace in Amazonie and are willing to fight for it."
 dvg_amazonie.2.a: "We really are a democracy, not just a republic!"
 
 dvg_amazonie.3.t: "The Brésilvilles"
 dvg_amazonie.3.d: "Some free Black Amazoniens have managed to garner enough of their own wealth to build their own towns as part of their own philanthropic efforts."
 dvg_amazonie.3.f: "Often, these towns have come to be known as 'Brésilvilles', based on the wood used to build them. As most institutions in Amazonie follow a racial segregation policy, these towns have become a place to provide basic resources and services to Black Amazoniens, whether they immigrated here, were born free, or were former slaves. This has drawn the ire of White Planteurs who allege that some of their own slaves are escaping to these 'Brésilvilles' and are taking away land that should have been entitled to. Since we are a country that values private ownership, the legality of these towns have come into question."
 dvg_amazonie.3.a: "There is no issue for doing whatever you can with your money."
 dvg_amazonie.3.b: "This is a threat to Amazonien land and Planteur property." 

 dvg_amazonie.4.t: "The Planteurs Insurrection"
 dvg_amazonie.4.d: "Angered by our efforts to abolish slavery and unwilling to compromise on their power, the Planteur class have formed their own breakaway state."
 dvg_amazonie.4.f: "Accordingly, they have managed to convince other White Amazoniens that the abolition of slavery is also a threat to their social status as well, and now many of these reactionaries are seeking to overthrow the government and restore the old Amazonien laws."
 dvg_amazonie.4.a: "While they to bring men to chains, we will fight to keep men free!"
 
 dvg_amazonie.5.t: "Integration of Equinoxea"
 dvg_amazonie.5.d: "As expected, the Amazonien government wants to further centralize the country by bringing the Equinoxean states in line with the rest of the country."
 dvg_amazonie.5.f: "We can do this easy way or the hard way they said."
 dvg_amazonie.5.a: "Equinoxea shall not go down without a fight!"
 dvg_amazonie.5.b: "If Black Amazoniens can be free, there's we can rejoin peacefully!"
 
 dvg_amazonie.6.t: "Equinoxiens Refuse Integration! "
 dvg_amazonie.6.d: "As expected, the Equinoxiens are resisting our efforts to integrate them!"
 dvg_amazonie.6.f: "Well, looks like we will have to do this hard way."
 dvg_amazonie.6.a: "..and we refuse their refusal!"
 dvg_amazonie.6.b: "Let's just keep the status quo."

dvg_annex_equinoxea_desc: "The existence of autonomous Equinoxean states undermine the authority of our laws. The time has come to centralize the country and bring them into our fold."
