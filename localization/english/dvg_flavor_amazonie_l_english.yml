 dvg_amazonie.1.t: "The Federation of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
 dvg_amazonie.1.d: "As of 1836, we are the only independent and recognized 'democratic' republic on the continent unlike our neighbors to the south and north."
 dvg_amazonie.1.f: "Yet, that notion is contested as the slavery debate rages on in the country. The western states of Equinoxea want to abolish slavery in all of the country, while most White Amazoniens in the east led by the Planteur class would rather see its practice continue and not give up their power. For now, a compromise has been made with the Equinoxiens being under our sovereignty but handling their own domestic affairs, abolising slavery and giving their Black populace citizenship within their jurisdiction. While Amazonie does enable free elections to an extent, voting enfranchisement is largely wealth based and thus the Planteurs have had an almost oligarchic hold on the country's politics. Still, it is thanks to them [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] managed to gain its independence peacefully, by paying off the Dual Monarchy with cash crops rather than go into armed conflict. "
 dvg_amazonie.1.a: "Good thing we're just a Republic, not a Democracy!"
 
 dvg_amazonie.2.t: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
 dvg_amazonie.2.d: "As of 1836, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] are able to grant universal suffrage, abolish slavery, and recognize citizenship regardless of race."
 dvg_amazonie.2.f: "This is in stark contrast with the rest of Amazonie which instead gives the Planteur class a near-oligarchic hold on politics and is also considerably wealthier. Currently, we are allowed to practice our own laws in autonomy thanks to the compromise reached with the Amazonien government. This compromise is not likely to last forever though, as the Equinoxean laws and ideals might threaten the Planteur grip on power should they spread across Amazonie. Respectively, many Equinoxiens also hope to abolish slavery and enfranchise all of the populace in Amazonie and are willing to fight for it."
 dvg_amazonie.2.a: "We really are a democracy, not just a republic!"
 
 dvg_amazonie.3.t: "The Brésilvilles"
 dvg_amazonie.3.d: "Some free Black Amazoniens have managed to garner enough of their own wealth to build their own towns as part of their own philanthropic efforts."
 dvg_amazonie.3.f: "Often, these towns have come to be known as 'Brésilvilles', based on the wood used to build them. As most institutions in Amazonie follow a racial segregation policy, these towns have become a place to provide basic resources and services to Black Amazoniens, whether they immigrated here, were born free, or were former slaves. This has drawn the ire of White Planteurs who allege that some of their own slaves are escaping to these 'Brésilvilles' and are taking away land that should have been entitled to. Since we are a country that values private ownership, the legality of these towns have come into question."
 dvg_amazonie.3.a: "There is no issue for doing whatever you can with your money."
 dvg_amazonie.3.b: "This is a threat to Amazonien land and Planteur property." 

 dvg_amazonie.4.t: "The Planteurs' Insurrection"
 dvg_amazonie.4.d: "Angered by our efforts to abolish slavery and unwilling to compromise on their power, the Planteur class have formed their own breakaway state in the form of 'Antartica'."
 dvg_amazonie.4.f: "Accordingly, they have managed to convince other White Amazoniens in the east of the country that the abolition of slavery is also a threat to their social status as well, and now many of these reactionaries are seeking to overthrow the government and restore the old Amazonien laws. However, since our politics have become more in-line with what the Equinoxiens have wanted, western Amazonie is still under our control with troops still loyal to the government."
 dvg_amazonie.4.a: "While they to bring men to chains, we will fight to keep men free!"
 dvg_amazonie.4.b: "God save the Antartique!"
 
 dvg_amazonie.5.t: "Integration Of Equinoxea"
 dvg_amazonie.5.d: "As expected, the Amazonien government wants to further centralize the country by bringing the Equinoxean states in line with the rest of the country."
 dvg_amazonie.5.f: "We can do this easy way or the hard way they said."
 dvg_amazonie.5.a: "Equinoxea shall not go down without a fight!"
 dvg_amazonie.5.b: "If Black Amazoniens can be free, there's we can rejoin peacefully!"
 
 dvg_amazonie.6.t: "Equinoxiens Refuse Integration!"
 dvg_amazonie.6.d: "As expected, the Equinoxiens are resisting our efforts to integrate them!"
 dvg_amazonie.6.f: "Well, looks like we will have to do this hard way."
 dvg_amazonie.6.a: "..and we refuse their refusal!"
 dvg_amazonie.6.b: "Let's just keep the status quo."
 
 dvg_amazonie.7.t: "Amazonie Demands The Return Of Fugitive Slaves"
 dvg_amazonie.7.d: "Since Amazonie allows slavery but we have abolished it, many runaway slaves from Amazonie have fled to our country to start new lives. Now, Amazonie is threatening military force if we do not abide by their demands."
 dvg_amazonie.7.f: "Currently, our policy has been to welcome these runaway slaves and recognize them as citizens of our country. Many of these ex-slaves have gone on to become essential workers, build up their own wealth, and even become entrepeneurs or become educated professionals thanks to our policies. To return them back to Amazonien captivity would be a betrayal of our liberal ideals, but is it worth risking a possible invasion by Amazonie?"
 dvg_amazonie.7.a: "We shall always defend the liberty of our citizens and those who immigrate to our coutnry, regardless of their origin!"
 dvg_amazonie.7.b: "It is best we avoid violence and preserve our existence regardless of the circumstances."
 
 dvg_amazonie.8.t: "Atlantia Refuses To Return Fugitive Slaves"
 dvg_amazonie.8.d: "Claiming they will defend their sovereignty and citizens, the Atlantians have decided against allowing the extradition of any former Amazonien slaves within their territory."
 dvg_amazonie.8.f: "Clearly, the Atlantians do not care to respect our authority. Since slaves are considered property under Amazonien law, invading them is simply us trying to take back our lost property that has been stolen by these liberals who are only a bad influence on our people."
 dvg_amazonie.8.a: "Atlantia was once Amazonien territory and it shall be again!"
 dvg_amazonie.8.b: "Well, we were never that serious about our demands anyway."
 
 dvg_amazonie.9.t: "The Integration of Equinoxea"
 dvg_amazonie.9.d: "As our troops march into Vaura, we have been able to restore order to our country."
 dvg_amazonie.9.f: "The Equinoxiens could have surrendered without a fight, but they chose to resist the inevitable. Now, the question still remains on how we should deal with the Equinoxien politicians now that their attempt of seperatism has been defeated. Letting them stay in power would anger the Planteurs."
 dvg_amazonie.9.a: "They can stay in power if they want."
 dvg_amazonie.9.b: "Traitors must die!"
 dvg_amazonie.9.c: "Never mind that, want to run away to the jungle too..."
 
 dvg_amazonie.10.t: "Pará Seized"
 dvg_amazonie.10.d: "Pará has been seized by the Amazoniens."
 dvg_amazonie.10.f: "The Amazoniens to our south have taken advantage of us being at war to take the state of Pará from our control."
 dvg_amazonie.10.a: "We will get our state back!"
 
 dvg_amazonie.11.t: "The Brésilien Secession"
 dvg_amazonie.11.d: "A group of Afro-Amerigans calling themselves the Brésiliens after the Brésilvilles, have decided to declare their independence."
 dvg_amazonie.11.f: "Believing there is no hope for them the way our country is currently going, the Brésilvilles have decided to unite and form their own independent nation."
 dvg_amazonie.11.a: "Traitors!"
 
 dvg_amazonie.12.t: "Liberty for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
 dvg_amazonie.12.d: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] was able to abolish slavery peacefully without much unrest. "
 dvg_amazonie.12.f: "This might have angered the Planteurs, but thanks to their diminished influence they were not able to cause much trouble."
 dvg_amazonie.12.a: "All men are created equal!"
 
 dvg_amazonie.13.t: "Federation Collapse"
 dvg_amazonie.13.d: "Since [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] was not able to resolve the slavery debate, the federation has collapsed."
 dvg_amazonie.13.f: "This time however, the Equinoxiens were not alone in their revolt. The Atlantians seemed to have interfered with this civil war as well, and given their influence in Gouas, have convinced the government there to declare neutrality in this civil war and the state's independence, thereby expressing the supremacy of Gouas laws over that of Amazonie. With the Equinoxiens in the way, our colonization efforts in the Amazon rainforest have also collapsed as the natives have retaken what jurisdiction we had there."
 dvg_amazonie.13.a: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] must stay strong!"
 dvg_amazonie.13.b: "Go Go [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_GOU').GetName] Rangers!"
 dvg_amazonie.13.c: "The Cock Flag of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_ATL').GetName] flies for freedom!"
 dvg_amazonie.13.ab: "[SCOPE.sCountry('scope_EQX').GetName] will bring salvation to all Amazoniens!"
 dvg_amazonie.13.aa: "[SCOPE.sCountry('scope_TUP').GetName] Time!"
 
 dvg_amazonie.14.t: "Dealing with the Brésiliens"
 dvg_amazonie.14.d: "Over time, some Afro-Amerigans have gained enough wealth to build themselves their own villages called 'Bresilvilles', with the inhabitants being known as 'Brésiliens.' "
 dvg_amazonie.14.f: "However, it has been brought back into question once more on how to deal with these villages. Are we going to let them do as they please on land that we claim, or will we teach them a lesson?"
 dvg_amazonie.14.a: "The Amazon Rainforest belongs to the Amazoniens!"
 dvg_amazonie.14.b: "Let's leave them be."
 
 dvg_amazonie.15.t: "The Brésilien Class"
 dvg_amazonie.15.d: "Thanks to us allowing the Brésiliens to continue their community-building efforts, they have become more influential within Amazonie."
 dvg_amazonie.15.f: "By being able to coalesce together, they are now able to band together to build political momentum to become an interest group with some clout."
 dvg_amazonie.15.a: "The Brésiliens are welcome to advocate for their interests in our capitol whenever."
 dvg_amazonie.15.b: "This is a threat to Amazonie. We should deny them any political influence."

 dvg_amazonie.16.t: "Post-Equinoxea Land Policy"
 dvg_amazonie.16.d: "Following the re-intergration of the Equinoxien states, the question on what the federal land policy should be has been brought up."
 dvg_amazonie.16.f: "Given how unsettled the region was, most Afro-Amerigans and Amazoniens followed a tenant farming policy. However, with many of them now having been disenfranchised following the war, the Planteurs see this as an oppurtunity to expand their holdings through a nationwide tenant farming policy."
 dvg_amazonie.16.a: "We beat the Equinoxiens with Planteur might, and therefore the Planteurs shall be rewarded."
 dvg_amazonie.16.b: "Let the ex-rebels keep their land, hopefully they will calm down." 

 dvg_amazonie.17.t: "The Secluded Haven of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
 dvg_amazonie.17.d: "A group of Afro-Amerigans managed to escape Amazonie's integration of Equinoxea, and re-establish their own town deeper in the jungle."
 dvg_amazonie.17.f: "Far away from any recognized country,  [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is currently one of the last refuges for Afro-Amerigans hoping to escape the cluthes of slavery in a place where they can be the ones in charge."
 dvg_amazonie.17.a: "Hopefully we can survive!"
