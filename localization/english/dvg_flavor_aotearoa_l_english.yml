 dvg_approach_aotearoa_desc:0 "The Máolì hold a significant powerbase north of our colony in Ny Sjælland. Perhaps rather than using steel and blood to take control over the island, we could approach them with a treaty, offering to protect them from other powers vying for their land?"
 
 #Events
 
 dvg_aotearoa.1.t:0 "The Treaty of Løfby"
 dvg_aotearoa.1.d:0 "The Scandinavians have drafted a treaty, having arrived with an envoy headed by Lars Dubenson in Manawahi."
 dvg_aotearoa.1.f:0 "Lars Dubenson, the official Scandinavian envoy to Aotearoa has arrived in the small settlement of Manawahi, offering Aotearoa the protectorship of Scandinavia, citing the need to protect Aotearoan sovereignty. Whilst this would both be beneficial ourselves, this would give the Scandinavians access to the resources of our homeland, along with further control over our nation, even if we're not wiped off the map by blood and steel."
 dvg_aotearoa.1.a:0 "This is to the benefit of the both of our nations, we accept"
 dvg_aotearoa.1.b:0 "We Máolì will survive, without Scandinavian oversight!"
 dvg_aotearoa.2.t:0 "The Treaty of Manawahi"
 dvg_aotearoa.2.d:0 "Recently we have been approached by a group of diplomats from [SCOPE.sCountry('aotearoa_approacher').GetName] in Manawahi, offering Aotearoa their protection."
 dvg_aotearoa.2.f:0 "We have closely watched the activities on the south island, seeing the growing colonies and small settlements appear along the shores, those settlements being of a foreign power. The have given us a treaty, requesting that we become a protectorate under them, citing that they will protect the Máolì people as if they were their own, however this would also mean that Aotearoa would fall into their sphere, becoming dependent of a foreign power and at their whim. Now we must debate on whether or not to accept their treaty..."
 dvg_aotearoa.2.a:0 "This is to the benefit of the both of our nations, we accept"
 dvg_aotearoa.2.b:0 "We Máolì need no such protection!"
 dvg_aotearoa.3.t:0 "The Máolì Accept!"
 dvg_aotearoa.3.d:0 "Lars Dubenson has returned to Scandinavia to report that Aotearoa is now a protectorate of Scandinavia!"
 dvg_aotearoa.3.f:0 "Following closely behind Mr Dubenson are several Máolì diplomats who have arrived to set up a small embassy in our capital to maintain contact between Aotearoa and ourselves. Now that Aotearoa has become a protectorate, we will need to protect them from any would-be invaders, meanwhile we may have access to their resources and markets, to a limited degree of course, yet no doubt as more treaties are written, they will become a close ally to the Scandinavian people."
 dvg_aotearoa.3.a:0 "A perfect outcome!"
 dvg_aotearoa.4.t:0 "The Máolì Accept!"
 dvg_aotearoa.4.d:0 "Our envoy has returned excitedly to our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName], bringing good news; the Máolì have accepted our generous offer!"
 dvg_aotearoa.4.f:0 "Bringing with him a small group of Máolì men, ready to begin setting up a small embassy in our capital, we have invited them to a celebration for a toast to our new Máolì partners! Whilst we may owe Aotearoa our protection, we have access to their bountiful, virgin lands, allowing us to take our shovels to their dirt, perhaps finding the same fortunes found in Qingqiu? And all for the price of needing to watch over a fairly quiet corner of our ever-growing dominion? Truly we excel in diplomacy!"
 dvg_aotearoa.4.a:0 "A toast to Aotearoa!"
 dvg_aotearoa.5.t:0 "A Treaty with Aotearoa"
 dvg_aotearoa.5.d:0 "As our conquest of the south island of Ny Sjælland is completed, we shall contact the Máolì of the north!"
 dvg_aotearoa.5.f:0 "Whilst it may have taken blood and steel to bring the south island under our control, wasting more our of peoples' precious lives would be an embarrassment, especially considering that the Máolì of the north have formed a much more organised and modern state! Perhaps instead, we could approach them and bring them into the fold via diplomatic endeavors, whilst not guaranteed, it is unlikely that we will lose anything in the exchange! We will request contact with Aotearoa as soon as possible!"
 dvg_aotearoa.5.a:0 "Deft diplomacy is our specialty anyway!"
 dvg_aotearoa.6.t:0 "Lars Dubenson reports Máolì refusal"
 dvg_aotearoa.6.d:0 "Addressing our government, Lars Dubenson has informed us that the Máolì have refused our generous offer of protection!"
 dvg_aotearoa.6.f:0 ""We cannot accept this offer of protection, Aotearoa sees it fit that the Scandinavians and Máolì remain apart. Aotearoa has means to protect itself, using diplomacy first and if need be, our military." - excerpt of the Aotearoan letter. War-hawks in our government have demanded that we respond with action against Aotearoa, yet others have advised us that such a move would be wasteful when there are other things we should lend our attention to. Now comes the time where we must decide how to respond..."
 dvg_aotearoa.6.a:0 "Unacceptable! Respond with threats of war!"
 dvg_aotearoa.6.b:0 "Fine, fine, let us forget this endeavor."
 dvg_aotearoa.7.t:0 "Aotearoa refuses our offer!"
 dvg_aotearoa.7.d:0 "Our diplomats have returned to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName] with reports that Aotearoa has refused our generous offer of protection!"
 dvg_aotearoa.7.f:0 "Addressing our government in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName], our diplomats report a failure to bring Aotearoa into our sphere, with the Máolì failing to see that our offer is beneficial to the both of us! Some in our government consider this endeavor to be a total failure and that it would be wise to cut our losses, yet others suggest that we invade Aotearoa instead, seeing the offer as a demand more-so than an offer of partnership! We must make a decision on how to respond to their refusal!"
 dvg_aotearoa.7.a:0 "Threaten an invasion!"
 dvg_aotearoa.7.b:0 "Cut our losses, the south island is enough for now."
 dvg_aotearoa.8.t:0 "Scandinavia Threatens War!"
 dvg_aotearoa.8.d:0 "We have recieved a curt letter from Scandinavia, simply demanding us to back down and submit to them!"
 dvg_aotearoa.8.f:0 "Signed by Lars Dubenson, the letter reads; "The Aotearoan response has been most innapropriate and offensive to the Scandinavian People. The Scandinavian government sees it fit to respond accordingly, we give you one final offer; Aotearoa will submit to Scandinavian overlordship, lest we invade the Aotearoan homeland.". Clearly the Scandinavians have shown their unwillingness to engage in fair and meaningful diplomacy, yet our hands are tied, we must respond to their letter should we risk total destruction!"
 dvg_aotearoa.8.a:0 "We cannot face the Scandinavians, give in to their demands."
 dvg_aotearoa.8.b:0 "Prepare for war, may the Máolì live for a century more!" 
 dvg_aotearoa.9.t:0 "[SCOPE.sCountry('aotearoa_approacher').GetName] Threatens War!"
 dvg_aotearoa.9.d:0 "We have recieved a curt letter from [SCOPE.sCountry('aotearoa_approacher').GetName] simply demanding us to back down and submit to them!"
 dvg_aotearoa.9.f:0 ""We see it fit that the Aotearoans face appropriate consequences after delivering a blatantly offensive letter to [SCOPE.sCountry('aotearoa_approacher').GetName], which has been deeply insulting to the [SCOPE.sCountry('aotearoa_approacher').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] people! We offer you this; submit to us, or face our soldiers on the shores.". Whilst this letter is a clear show of a lack of integrity and fair diplomacy on their part, we must respond to their demands!"
 dvg_aotearoa.9.a:0 "We cannot face them, give in to their demands."
 dvg_aotearoa.9.b:0 "Prepare for war, may the Máolì live for a century more!"
 dvg_aotearoa.10.t:0 "Aotearoa refuses to submit!"
 dvg_aotearoa.10.d:0 "Aotearoa has refused our demand to submit, we have began preparing for war immediately!"
 dvg_aotearoa.10.f:0 "Following several interactions between prominent Máolì diplomats and Lars Dubenson, we have come to an impass, with the only option being war! The Máolì have insulted the Scandinavian people and refused our generous offer, it is obvious that they cannot be trusted, we will march into Manawahi and keep a tight leash on them once we arrive!"
 dvg_aotearoa.10.a:0 "We never wanted it to come to this, but we have."
 dvg_aotearoa.11.t:0 "The Máolì Finally Cave"
 dvg_aotearoa.11.d:0 "Following several interactions between prominent Máolì diplomats and Lars Dubenson, the Máolì have wisely decided to submit."
 dvg_aotearoa.11.f:0 "The Scandinavian have grown impatient of playing the Máolì's game, or at least the war-hawks of our government have! However, it seems that our threats of an invasion have scared the Máolì, they have presented us with a treaty that will see Aotearoa become a closely-monitored puppet of Scandinavia, with a loyalist government overseeing the Máolì people and informing them of their new position within our dominion. Thankfully it did not come to an invasion, the Máolì have wisely made the right move, even if it did take a little convincing!"
 dvg_aotearoa.11.a:0 "Scandinavia prevails!"
 dvg_aotearoa.12.t:0 "Aotearoa refuses to submit!"
 dvg_aotearoa.12.d:0 "Aotearoa has refused our demand to submit, we have began preparing for war immediately!"
 dvg_aotearoa.12.f:0 "We have been met with nothing but rude refusal from Aotearoa, it is clear that they are not willing to negotiate an equitable treaty, our hand has been forced! We cannot idly sit by any longer, war hawks in our government have grown restless and the Máolì have insulted us! We must begin mobilising our army at once and planning an invasion, should the schemers of Aotearoa get any ideas about stealing our lands away from us in Ny Sjælland!"
 dvg_aotearoa.12.a:0 "They have forced our hands, begin the invasion!"
 dvg_aotearoa.13.t:0 "The Máolì Finally Cave"
 dvg_aotearoa.13.d:0 "Following several interactions between prominent Máolì diplomats and our diplomats, the Máolì have wisely decided to submit."
 dvg_aotearoa.13.f:0 "Our government celebrates as Aotearoa is bought into the [SCOPE.sCountry('aotearoa_approacher').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] sphere! Finally our diplomatic dance is finished and our advance into Ny Sjælland is furthered, we must now usher in a new age to the Máolì people, bringing them modern technology and showing them a proper lifestyle - our lifestyle! A toast to our new Máolì will be held in our capital to celebrate the occaision!"
 dvg_aotearoa.13.a:0 "What is diplomacy but a measure of military might?"
 dvg_aotearoa.14.t:0 "Scandinavia Pressures Aotearoa!"
 dvg_aotearoa.14.d:0 "With Scandinavian posturing in Ny Sjælland, we must make a stance and make it clear to them!"
 dvg_aotearoa.14.f:0 "Recently Scandinavia has began discourse with Aotearoa, our tributary state, in an effort to swing them to the Scandinavian sphere! Whilst the Aotearoans are yet to decide on a response, it is clear that Scandinavia does not intend to be reasonable; communicating with Aotearoa before us! We can't yet tell how far this will escalate, but we should make our stance clear as discourse continues between Aotearoa and Scandinavia. Now the question lingers - should we stand by Aotearoa and risk war with the powerful Scandinavian state? Or should we turn our backs and save our people from a war that we can clearly not win..."
 dvg_aotearoa.14.a:0 "Mianjin will fight for her subjects sovereignty, no matter what we must face!"
 dvg_aotearoa.14.b:0 "We cannot afford a war with the meddling Scandinavians, inform them that Aotearoa is theirs!"
 dvg_aotearoa.15.t:0 "[SCOPE.sCountry('aotearoa_approacher').GetName] Pressures Aotearoa!"
 dvg_aotearoa.15.d:0 "The recent [SCOPE.sCountry('aotearoa_approacher').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] posturing in Ny Sjælland has come to our attention, we must make our stance on this clear to them!"
 dvg_aotearoa.15.f:0 "Mianjin, as everyone knows, is a loyal and benevolent state, having set up Aotearoa and put them on a path towards being a civilised nation like ourselves, we owe them our protection, at a price no doubt! However recent diplomatic exchanges between [SCOPE.sCountry('aotearoa_approacher').GetName] and Aotearoa show that the status-quo may not last! We should make it known whether or not we stand with Aotearoa, or should we leave them to their fate, for surely it is not worth a war with [SCOPE.sCountry('aotearoa_approacher').GetName] over a small and isolated island?"
 dvg_aotearoa.15.a:0 "Mianjin protects her subjects! We will do what we must!"
 dvg_aotearoa.15.b:0 "We cannot afford a war with [SCOPE.sCountry('aotearoa_approacher').GetName], we can afford to concede Aotearoa"
 dvg_aotearoa.16.t:0 "Mianjin protects Aotearoa!"
 dvg_aotearoa.16.d:0 "The inferior Mianjin forces have pledged to defend Aotearoa should war be waged!?|"
 dvg_aotearoa.16.f:0 "Thier forces may be much smaller and less hardy than our own, not to mention nowhere near as well-trained or disciplined! Yet they have still foolishly decided to oppose us should we find ourselves invading the Aotearoan heartland. No doubt we will simply roll over them like we have our enemies of the psat!"
 dvg_aotearoa.16.a:0 "We will crush them too if need be!"
 dvg_aotearoa.17.t:0 "Mianjin leaves Aotearoa to us"
 dvg_aotearoa.17.d:0 "A diplomat from Mianjin has informed us that the Mianjin government has cut ties with Aotearoa following our intervention."
 dvg_aotearoa.17.f:0 ""We seek no hostilities between our nations, Mianjin simply seeks peace in Zhourao and the Zhourao seas." - A Mianjin diplomat spoke earlier at our holdings in Ny Sjælland. We are not surprised to learn that Mianjin has backed down, considering our military and industrial might! No doubt this was done simply to save face, we can simply brush their concerns on the issue aside."
 dvg_aotearoa.17.a:0 "A cowardly nation of cowardly people..."
 dvg_aotearoa.18.t:0 "Scandinavia swindles us out of Aotearoa!"
 dvg_aotearoa.18.d:0 "Unexpectedly, the Scandinavians have stolen Aotearoa from right under our noses, bold of them to assume we would not notice."
 dvg_aotearoa.18.f:0 "A rather curt letter arrived at [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName] today, the letter itself being signed by several newly appointed Máolì diplomats in Scandinavian Aotearoa along with a few Scandinavian names at the bottom of the page, stamped with the Scandinavian seal! This is a clear violation of international treaties between Aotearoa and ourselves, yet it is little but doubtful that the international community will respond to our outcries. We must demand that Scandinavia returns Aotearoa to our oversight immediately! Alternatively, we could simply let the issue fall to the wayside and move forwards..."
 dvg_aotearoa.18.a:0 "Begin drafting the demand now!"
 dvg_aotearoa.18.b:0 "We cannot stand up to the might of Scandinavia."
 dvg_aotearoa.19.t:0 "[SCOPE.sCountry('aotearoa_approacher').GetName] steals Aotearoa!"
 dvg_aotearoa.19.d:0 "Our loyal tributary, Aotearoa has turned their back on us following diplomatic exchanges with [SCOPE.sCountry('aotearoa_approacher').GetName]!"
 dvg_aotearoa.19.f:0 "Whilst we would have expected our generosity to keep Aotearoa towing our line and following the right path, it appears that violent threats from [SCOPE.sCountry('aotearoa_approacher').GetName] have forced the Aotearoan hand and turned them away from us! This action is clearly unacceptable and we, as honest and just people, must right this wrong! We should send a demand to [SCOPE.sCountry('aotearoa_approacher').GetName] warning them of their transgressions and demanding that they turn suzerainty back over to us! Or, we could let the issue lie and move forwards, even if it is less resource intensive and pragmatic, no doubt the international community will not see it the same way..."
 dvg_aotearoa.19.a:0 "Send a demand as soon as possible!"
 dvg_aotearoa.19.b:0 "Forget this, we cannot face [SCOPE.sCountry('aotearoa_approacher').GetName] should they make threats."
 dvg_aotearoa.20.t:0 "Mianjin demands the return of Aotearoa"
 dvg_aotearoa.20.d:0 "Following our recent friendly engagement with Aotearoa, Mianjin has taken overreacted and taken issue with this, demanding we return Aotearoa to their suzerainty."
 dvg_aotearoa.20.f:0 "Mianjin has cited that Aotearoa has previously been their tributary, sending packages of money and exotic goods back to Mianjin in return for funding of the Máolì state and new technologies. However, we can find no such record of these exchanges, it is clear to us based on our own investigations that our intervention was perfectly legal. However, we must send a response back to the increasingly more angry Mianjin diplomats, we could simply keep Aotearoa for ourselves, or we could avoid the hassle of continued negative relations with the Mianjin and simply return Aotearoa to them, silly as might seem..."
 dvg_aotearoa.20.a:0 "Let them continue to make threats, what they can they do against us?"
 dvg_aotearoa.20.b:0 "Fine, fine, they can have that pitiful island if they insist."
 dvg_aotearoa.21.t:0 "The Mianjin demand we return Aotearoa!"
 dvg_aotearoa.21.d:0 "Following recent diplomatic exchanges between ourselves and Aotearoa, the Mianjin have expressed outrage at our overlordship over Aotearoa!"
 dvg_aotearoa.21.f:0 "Their rage is unjustified, no doubt, we were well within our rights to engage with Aotearoa, however the Mianjin government thinks not! Sending an angry letter to our government in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName], whilst the letter is clearly an attempt at slandering our good name, we must give an official response. We could give in to their demands, handing back the island to the Mianjin with little negative side effects for ourselves, or we could simply ignore their angry words and pretend that they simply do not exist!"
 dvg_aotearoa.21.a:0 "Forget them, we have better things to do."
 dvg_aotearoa.21.b:0 "They can have it if they so insist."
 dvg_aotearoa.22.t:0 "Scandinavia refuses to return Aotearoa!"
 dvg_aotearoa.22.d:0 "Not only has Scandinavia wrongly taken Aotearoa from our hands, but has also now refused to return them!"
 dvg_aotearoa.22.f:0 "As it would seem we have come to an impass, with Scandinavia refusing to right their injustice against us and rightfully return Aotearoa, even following our demands, there is little more that we can do. Lest we begin to mobilise against the Scandinavian state, for the time for diplomacy has ended, Scandinavia has forced our hand and left our only option being war! Yet perhaps this has gone too far, for surely it is not worth fighting over an undeveloped island? Along with the fact that the Scandinavian army is potentially too much for us to handle..."
 dvg_aotearoa.22.a:0 "War it shall be then!"
 dvg_aotearoa.22.b:0 "We would be foolish to fight Scandinavia."
 dvg_aotearoa.23.t:0 "[SCOPE.sCountry('aotearoa_approacher').GetName] refuses to return Aotearoa!"
 dvg_aotearoa.23.d:0  "We have tried every other option with [SCOPE.sCountry('aotearoa_approacher').GetName], yet they refuse to negotiate meaningfully, leaving us with no other option!"
 dvg_aotearoa.23.f:0 "[SCOPE.sCountry('aotearoa_approacher').GetName] has sent us another letter in return, informing us that our demands are an overreaction and a mere fabrication! They have tied our hands, leaving us with little other options, for we have attempted all other routes of diplomacy! Only one such method of recovering Aotearoa remains... Whilst we cannot say for sure who is stronger between ourselves and [SCOPE.sCountry('aotearoa_approacher').GetName], for surely our morale and tactics alone can drive any enemy away, the much more brutish tactics of [SCOPE.sCountry('aotearoa_approacher').GetName] may prove to be more effective in battle, meaning that it might be better to simply forget the problem..."
 dvg_aotearoa.23.a:0 "So it's on, the negotiations' gone!"
 dvg_aotearoa.23.b:0 "Aotearoa is their's to steal, let's focus on what is real instead."
