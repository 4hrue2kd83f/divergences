 aprilfools.1.t:0 "The End of Poland"
 aprilfools.1.d:0 "Oh, accursed meteor, thou art the ruiner of all that is good and holy!"
 aprilfools.1.f:0 "In the year of our Lord 1830, a great celestial wonder did manifest itself in the heavens above Poland. A mighty meteor, its fiery trail brightening the night sky, did streak towards the earth with great speed and force. With a deafening roar, the meteor did collide with the earth, unleashing a potent blast that fractured the very air. The ground quaked beneath the feet of those who beheld this spectacle, and vast plumes of dust and detritus did billow forth from the capital and Brest. The people of Poland did marvel at this prodigious event, for such celestial phenomena were a rare and uncommon sight for mortal eyes. Many speculated as to the significance of this heavenly omen and what ill omens it might portend for the future. As they pondered these mysteries, their thoughts turned to the fate of their king and nobility. But ere news could arrive from the capital, the various lords of Poland renounced their allegiance to the crown, choosing instead to be sovereigns of their own domains and lands. Yet, even as they marveled, the people of Poland could not escape a creeping sense of unease, for they knew that such a prodigious impact could not pass unnoticed by the world beyond. And so, with trepidation, they steeled themselves for the uncertain fate that the heavens had in store for them."
