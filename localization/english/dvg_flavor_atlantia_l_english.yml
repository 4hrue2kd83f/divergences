 dvg_atlantia.1.t: "The Future of Atlantia"
 dvg_atlantia.1.d: "The time has come to decide who should govern Atlantia."
 dvg_atlantia.1.f: "For decades now, Atlantia has remained relatively peaceful as a buffer state between Amazonie and Lotharingia under Spanish sovereignty. However, there are an increasing amount of Atlantians seeking a different future."
 dvg_atlantia.1.a: "We should join Amazonie!"
 dvg_atlantia.1.b: "We should join Lotharingia!"
 dvg_atlantia.1.c: "We should become independent!"
 
 dvg_atlantia.2.t: "A Victory for Liberty"
 dvg_atlantia.2.d: "After much deliberation, the Atlantians have decided to join our fledgling democracy instead of the tyrannical rule of their former masters."
 dvg_atlantia.2.f: "It is unlikely De Aigle will respect this, as he is already accusing the Atlantian referendum of being rigged, not that we would know anything of course. "
 dvg_atlantia.2.a: "Vive la Democratie!"
 
 dvg_atlantia.3.t: "The Return of the Golden Province"
 dvg_atlantia.3.d: "After much deliberation, the Atlantians have decided to rejoin our republic once more."

 dvg_atlantia.4.t: "The Rigged Referendum"
 dvg_atlantia.4.d: "Allegedly, the Atlantians voted to join Amazonie as opposed to returning to us or seeking their own independence much to our anguish."
 dvg_atlantia.4.f: "These results are absolutely nonsensical, and was most likely the work of Amazonien agents bribing election officials and manipulating the results. Regardless, we must reconquer our lost land to show that we will purge corruption from the Golden Province!"

 dvg_atlantia.4.b: "We have better things to do."
 
 dvg_atlantia.5.t: "Aid from Atlantia?"
 dvg_atlantia.5.d: "The Atlantians are offering us aid in our fight against Lotharingia's attempts to annex us"
 dvg_atlantia.5.f: "Although this might be convenient, the Atlantians seem to be doing this to set us up as a buffer-puppet state for their future ambitions. This aid could really help, but may undermine our sovereignty."
 dvg_atlantia.5.a: "So what? We need all the help we can get."
 dvg_atlantia.5.b: "We can win this fight on our own."
 
 dvg_atlantia.6.t: "Nouvelle Alsace Refuses Aid"
 dvg_atlantia.6.d: "The leaders of Nouvelle Alsace saw through our plan and are not interested in our help."
 dvg_atlantia.6.f: "It seems like if we want to build a united Ameriga, we will have to look for other ways."
 dvg_atlantia.6.a: "Blast!"
 
 dvg_atlantia.7.t: "Integrating Nouvelle Alsace"
 dvg_atlantia.7.d: "Our control over Nouvelle Alsace has become so effective, they are now essentially under our control."
 dvg_atlantia.7.f: "Although this undermines their whole struggle for independence, at least they can now be safer under better hands."
 dvg_atlantia.7.a: "Vive les Amerigains!"
 
 dvg_atlantia.8.t: "Integrating Atlantia"
 dvg_atlantia.8.d: "Our control over Atlantia has become so effective, they are now essentially under our control."

 dvg_atlantia.9.t: "Atlantians supporting Separatists"
 dvg_atlantia.9.d: "We have reason to believe the Atlantians are trying to undermine us."
 dvg_atlantia.9.f: "Since we are already at war and Atlantia is effectively siding against us by aiding the enemy, we can take this chance to retake the Golden Province."
 dvg_atlantia.9.a: "Lotharingia must be reunited completely."
 dvg_atlantia.9.b: "We cannot afford an additional conflict on top of our current one."
