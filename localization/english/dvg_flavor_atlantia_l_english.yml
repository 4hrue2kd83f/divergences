 dvg_atlantia.10.t: "The Golden Board of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
 dvg_atlantia.10.d: "As the circumstances around it change, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] finds itself at a crossroads."
 dvg_atlantia.10.f: "Initially a part of Burgundian Lotharingia, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] was later seized by Anglois forces and was later ceded to Spanish control as a neutral buffer state. Under Spanish rule, a 'Golden Board' was established due to discovery of gold in the area and the consequential destabilizing impact on the global economy. This board hosts Anglois, Burgundian, and Spanish delegations while excluding Amazoniens and Lotharians. This status quo is unlikely to last forever though, as Atlantia's gold dwindles and Spain finds itself in constant conflict elsewhere. Atlantia's neighbors are also aware of the potential future as well and have even sent members of their populace to help influence local politics. At the same time however, many Atlantians have developed their own distinguishable culture and may even seek a sovereign, independent Atlantia."
 dvg_atlantia.10.a: "The future is so far yet so near."
 
 dvg_atlantia.1.t: "The Future of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
 dvg_atlantia.1.d: "The time has come to decide who should govern [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
 dvg_atlantia.1.f: "For decades now, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has remained relatively peaceful as a buffer state between Amazonie and Lotharingia under Spanish sovereignty. However, there are an increasing amount of Atlantians seeking a different future. \n \n If we refuse to join Lotharingia, there is a good chance their armed forces will try to pillage and raze us. We could join Amazonie for protection as they are more liberal minded like many Atlantians are, but joining them would effectively disenfranchise our Black populace due to attitudes there regarding race. Of course, we could just decide to join neither, but we might not be prepared for a future invasion from either of them."
 dvg_atlantia.1.a: "We should join Amazonie!"
 dvg_atlantia.1.b: "We should join Lotharingia!"
 dvg_atlantia.1.c: "We should become independent!"
 
 dvg_atlantia.2.t: "A Victory for Liberty"
 dvg_atlantia.2.d: "After much deliberation, the Atlantians have decided to join our fledgling democracy instead of the tyrannical rule of their former masters."
 dvg_atlantia.2.f: "It is unlikely De Aigle will respect this, as he is already accusing the Atlantian referendum of being rigged, not that we would know anything of course. "
 dvg_atlantia.2.a: "Vive la Democratie!"
 
 dvg_atlantia.3.t: "The Return of the Golden Province"
 dvg_atlantia.3.d: "After much deliberation, the Atlantians have decided to rejoin our republic once more."
 dvg_atlantia.3.f: "It seems like nothing beats the power of threatening violence if you don't get your way, we would know very well of course."
 dvg_atlantia.3.a: "Vive la Republique!"
 
 dvg_atlantia.4.t: "The Rigged Referendum"
 dvg_atlantia.4.d: "Allegedly, the Atlantians voted to join Amazonie as opposed to returning to us or seeking their own independence much to our anguish."
 dvg_atlantia.4.f: "These results are absolutely nonsensical, and was most likely the work of Amazonien agents bribing election officials and manipulating the results. Regardless, we must reconquer our lost land to show that we will purge corruption from the Golden Province!"
 dvg_atlantia.4.a: "Cote du Cafe is Lotharian!"
 dvg_atlantia.4.b: "We have better things to do."
 
 dvg_atlantia.5.t: "Aid from Atlantia?"
 dvg_atlantia.5.d: "The Atlantians are offering us aid in our fight against Lotharingia's attempts to annex us"
 dvg_atlantia.5.f: "Although this might be convenient, the Atlantians seem to be doing this to set us up as a buffer-puppet state for their future ambitions. This aid could really help, but may undermine our sovereignty."
 dvg_atlantia.5.a: "So what? We need all the help we can get."
 dvg_atlantia.5.b: "We can win this fight on our own."
 
 dvg_atlantia.6.t: "Nouvelle Alsace Refuses Aid"
 dvg_atlantia.6.d: "The leaders of Nouvelle Alsace saw through our plan and are not interested in our help."
 dvg_atlantia.6.f: "It seems like if we want to build a united Ameriga, we will have to look for other ways."
 dvg_atlantia.6.a: "Blast!"
 
 dvg_atlantia.7.t: "Integrating Nouvelle Alsace"
 dvg_atlantia.7.d: "Our influence over Nouvelle Alsace has become so effective, they are now essentially under our control and even acclimating to our liberal ways."
 dvg_atlantia.7.f: "Already, Nouvelle Alsace is seeing infrastructure development and freedom they never would have seen under De Aigle's rule. Although this undermines their whole struggle for independence, at least we share a common struggle against autocracy and they can now protect what they have. They can now be safer under better hands."
 dvg_atlantia.7.a: "Vive les Amerigains! Stronger together!"
 
 dvg_atlantia.8.t: "Integrating Atlantia"
 dvg_atlantia.8.d: "Our influence over Atlantia has become so effective, they are now essentially under our control."
 dvg_atlantia.8.f: "Although this undermines their whole struggle for independence, Atlantia has always been eyed for by its neighbors due to its resources. If we don't get to them, somebody else will!"
 dvg_atlantia.8.a: "Vive les Amerigains! Stronger together!"
 
 dvg_atlantia.9.t: "Atlantians supporting Separatists"
 dvg_atlantia.9.d: "We have reason to believe the Atlantians are trying to undermine us. Our spies within Nouvelle Amsterdam have uncovered them sending money, troops, supplies, and training to the Nouvelsatians."
 dvg_atlantia.9.f: "Since we are already trying to unite the country with the current war and Atlantia is effectively siding against us by aiding the enemy, we can take this chance to retake the Golden Province. Are we just gonna let this wasp nest of dissidents do as they please with us? Our armed forces are insisting we stop this."
 dvg_atlantia.9.a: "We have never been about compromise. Atlantia Delenda Est!"
 dvg_atlantia.9.b: "The House of Cards is already pretty difficult to rebuild. We can't add another card of conflict just yet."
