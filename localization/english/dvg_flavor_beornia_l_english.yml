 je_conquest_new_cornwall: "Conquest of the Southern Deserts"
 je_conquest_new_cornwall_reason: "The Kingdom of Beornia's southern border was marked by the river Graham after a treaty with the Mapuche Tribes whom resisted our earlier attempts at settling these lands. The Incans have laid bare their own ambitions to seize the Amerigan Cone so it has become a necessity for us to seize the southern deserts in the name of the crown before they or anyone else does."

 je_cattle_barons_wrath_goal: "If King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] angers them to much, he risks getting ousted and replaced."

 dvg_beornia.1.t: "The English Monarchy in Exile"
 dvg_beornia.1.d: "Far away from its ancestral homeland, sits the only independent English-speaking country in the world."
 dvg_beornia.1.f: "Beornia is by all metrics the youngest nation in Ameriga as it was only claimed by English settlers in the 17th century crossing the Odon river, living in small towns often unknown by the Burgundian colonial administration. Over time, they developed a peculiar mindset of exiles distrustful of foreigners and keen to protect their language and culture with the wealthier among them being known as 'Cattle Barons'. \n\n One of these Cattle Barons, Harold Cavendish, claimed descent from the House Cavendish that once held the title of 'Duke of Newcastle'. His house was recognized to rule over these English-settled areas by the Burgundian authorities in 1709 for his efforts in destroying the Anglois settlement of Nouveau Havre that once inhabited the area. Now, with the Burgundians gone thanks to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] seeing the oppurtunity in helping Lotharingia's ruling class in their civil war and fight for independence, there are some in the government who seek to use this as a foundation to expand Beornia's influence further; whether it be annexing new lands or reclaiming old ones."

 dvg_beornia.2.a: "[SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('landowners_ig').GetName] needs to stop these raids immediately. We should not risk endangering lives."
 dvg_beornia.2.b: "Well you know what they say, survival of the fittest!"

 dvg_beornia.3.d: "Bands of Beornians are pillaging and razing villages near our border, infringing on our sovereignty and displacing our civilians."
 dvg_beornia.3.f: "Rumor has it that the one leading these raids is a Beornian prince, which could indicate these raids are state-sponsored too."
 dvg_beornia.3.a: "[SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('landowners_ig').GetName] needs to stop these raids immediately. We cannot risk endangering more lives."
