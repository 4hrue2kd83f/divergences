 je_conquest_new_cornwall: "Conquest of the Southern Deserts"
 je_conquest_new_cornwall_reason: "The Kingdom of Beornia's southern border was marked by the river Graham after a treaty with the Mapuche Tribes whom resisted our earlier attempts at settling these lands. The Incans have laid bare their own ambitions to seize the Amerigan Cone so it has become a necessity for us to seize the southern deserts in the name of the crown before they or anyone else does."
 je_cattle_barons_wrath: "Disapproval of the King"
 je_cattle_barons_wrath_reason: "Due to his ambitions to reshape the country and change its course, King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] faces opposition from the more conservative and reactionary elements within the country, most prominent of them being the Cattle Barons." 
 je_cattle_barons_wrath_goal: "If King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] angers his countrymen to much, he risks getting ousted and replaced."

 conquest_new_cornwall.1.t: "Settling New Cornwall"
 conquest_new_cornwall.1.d: "We have completed our long campaign to conquer the lands christened New Cornwall. Settlers are beginning to seek out promising sites from which to establish new towns and exploit the region's natural resources."
 conquest_new_cornwall.1.f: "The Mapuche fought long and hard for centuries to protect their lands from us. Now at last they are defeated, and the lands of New Cornwall are indisputable ours. Now we must set ourselves to the task of populating and governing what we have won."
 conquest_new_cornwall.1.a: "Today New Cornwall, tomorrow the Cone!"

 dvg_beornia.1.t: "The English Monarchy in Exile"
 dvg_beornia.1.d: "Far away from its ancestral homeland, sits the only independent English-speaking country in the world."
 dvg_beornia.1.f: "Beornia is by all metrics the youngest nation in Ameriga as it was only claimed by English settlers in the 17th century crossing the Odon river, living in small towns often unknown by the Burgundian colonial administration. Over time, they developed a peculiar mindset of exiles distrustful of foreigners and keen to protect their language and culture with the wealthier among them being known as 'Cattle Barons'. \n\n One of these Cattle Barons, Harold Cavendish, claimed descent from the House Cavendish that once held the title of 'Duke of Newcastle'. His house was recognized to rule over these English-settled areas by the Burgundian authorities in 1709 for his efforts in destroying the Anglois settlement of Nouveau Havre that once inhabited the area. Now, with the Burgundians gone thanks to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] seeing the oppurtunity in helping Lotharingia's ruling class in their civil war and fight for independence, there are some in the government who seek to use this as a foundation to expand Beornia's influence further; whether it be annexing new lands or reclaiming old ones." 
 dvg_beornia.1.a: "Maybe one day more people will speak English."
 
 dvg_beornia.2.t: "Border Raids"
 dvg_beornia.2.d: "As Beornians expand the nation's frontiers, they often engages with conflict with indigenous people already living in the area."
 dvg_beornia.2.f: "To help facilitate these Beornian settlements, King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]'s uncle Prince Charles and his allies have been raiding villages on the outer reaches of our country.\n \n Some in the capital question if armed farmers and herdsmen armed with antiquated weapons dangerously close to the Inka Empire border is a wise idea, but these raiders have been seen as heroes by the local populace. Ordering these raids stop won't go well them."
 dvg_beornia.2.a: "These raids need to stop immediately. We should not risk a war with the Inkas and endangering lives."
 dvg_beornia.2.b: "Well you know what they say, survival of the fittest!"
 
 dvg_beornia.3.t: "Beornian Raiders"
 dvg_beornia.3.d: "Bands of Beornians are pillaging and razing villages near our border, infringing on our sovereignty and displacing our civilians."
 dvg_beornia.3.f: "Rumor has it that the one leading these raids is a Beornian prince, which could indicate these raids are state-sponsored too. Given our empire's history being cut down by a foreign power, are we just going to sit by and let the same thing happen again? "
 dvg_beornia.3.a: "We can't stand idly by as these savages brutalize our people. To arms! Destroy their pathetic excuse of a kingdom!"
 dvg_beornia.3.b: "Let's teach them a lesson and subjugate their country!"
 dvg_beornia.3.c: "We have other things to focus on."
 
 dvg_beornia.4.t: "Beornia's Immigration Policy"
 dvg_beornia.4.d: "Given the country's poor economic prospects and future ambitions, the issue of immigration policy has become a heated debate among the country's populace."
 dvg_beornia.4.f: "Unsurprisingly, the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('landowners_ig').GetName] want a stricter immigration policy to preserve their power, while members of our clergy believe we are stronger with more of our cutlure within our country. The Edwardian Circle by contrast think having an ample amount of labor regardless of culture would greatly improve our situation, though this would radicalize the other Beornians who will see this as dilluting our country and increased competition for land and employment."
 dvg_beornia.4.a: "Beornia for Beornians only! Close the border!"
 dvg_beornia.4.b: "We can use more people, but preferably those of our kind."
 dvg_beornia.4.c: "Beornia needs all the help it can get if it wants to prosper! Open the border!"
 
 dvg_beornia.5.t: "A Union of the Crosses"
 dvg_beornia.5.d: "Due to our two countries' shared history, government, family ties, and culture, we have taken a step towards uniting under a shared crown."
 dvg_beornia.5.f: "This might anger some of the more nationalist elements within our country, but they might come to accept this over time."
 dvg_beornia.5.a: "Long live House Cavendish-Aigle!"

 
 dvg_beornia.6.t: "A Union of the Crosses"
 dvg_beornia.6.d: "Given the country's poor economic prospects and future ambitions, the issue of immigration policy has become a heated debate among the country's populace."
 dvg_beornia.6.f: "This might anger some of the more nationalist elements within our country, but they might come to accept this over time."
 dvg_beornia.6.a: "Long live House Aigle-Cavendish!"
 
 dvg_beornia.7.t: "Beornia wants to purchase the Falklands"
 dvg_beornia.7.d: "Being close to our South Atlantic Islands, Beornia would like to take the oppurtunity to take them off our hands."
 dvg_beornia.7.f: "Initially, we used these islands as a refueling stop, but given our modern-day technology and economic situation, this might not be so necessary to keep."
 dvg_beornia.7.a: "Sure, they can have a few rocks in the middle of nowhere."
 dvg_beornia.7.b: "Scandinavian territory is NOT to be purchased!"
 
 dvg_beornia.8.t: "The Lotharian Question"
 dvg_beornia.8.d: "Since Lotharingia has collapsed, we have our options of how to deal with our weakened neighbor."
 dvg_beornia.8.f: "Some might say the fact we are considering this in the first place might be a backstab to Denis de Aigle, but to be fair he still kinda owes us for helping him secure power to begin with."
 dvg_beornia.8.a: "We will help our old ally by taking Transfleuve from Odonia."
 dvg_beornia.8.b: "Odonia is culturally closer to us, anyway. We can help them if they agree to being under our sovereignty."

 dvg_beornia.9.t: "Cattle Barons' Coup"
 dvg_beornia.9.d: "King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]'s failure to reconcile the negative attitudes toward the government has led to him being ousted."
 dvg_beornia.9.f: "Discontent with the King, the Cattle Barons marched on the capital with guns and loyal soldiers to coup the government and have the King's uncle Charles crowned. Edward accepted and signed his renouncement to the throne. Now Charles has embarked on a policy of renewed purity and faithfulness and has declared his intention to purge every seditious member from Beornian society."
 dvg_beornia.9.a: "...and so the sun sets on the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]ian era!"
 
 dvg_beornia.10.t: "Cattle Barons' Coup Thwarted"
 dvg_beornia.10.d: "King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has successfully managed to curtail the influence of the Cattle Barons on the country and uncovered a plot to overthrow him."
 dvg_beornia.10.f: "Prince Charles has subsequently been arrested alongside the other Cattle Barons who were seeking to overthrow the king. Now, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] can choose any destiny that its King has set for it without worrying about the wrath of the old elite."
 dvg_beornia.10.a: "God Save Our Gracious King! Long may he reign!"
 
 dvg_beornia.11.t: "Powers of Parliament"
 dvg_beornia.11.d: "With King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] and the Cattle Barons being influential, the distribution of political power in the country has come into question."
 dvg_beornia.11.f: "The Cattle Barons are demanding that they have get some special voting privileges, being part of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]'s nobility. The harder reactionaries meanwhile demand the King not compromise with anyone else, while the reformers and radicals insist we give every Beornians a voice if the Cattle Barons get one too."
 dvg_beornia.11.a: "The King will maintain absolute authority."
 dvg_beornia.11.b: "Other aristocrats can share power within parliament."
 dvg_beornia.11.c: "All Beornians can share power within parliament."
 
 dvg_beornia.12.t: "The Future of Beornia"
 dvg_beornia.12.d: "For the tenture of his rule, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] managed to balance the interests of his country, not giving any interest group too much. "
 dvg_beornia.12.f: "In the end, he wasn't able to curtail the influence of the Cattle Barons, who still have a powerful influence in the country. Still, as nobody has managed to abolish the monarhcy either it is safe to say [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] can just simply continue existing as it always has." 
 dvg_beornia.12.a: "Long Live Beornia?"
 
 dvg_beornia.13.t: "A Scandinavian Intervention?"
 dvg_beornia.13.d: "A man by the name of Lars Hayardal who immigrated here from Scandinavia is asking to join our government as an advisor. He says he wants to protect the international fur trade and bolster our economy."
 dvg_beornia.13.f: "Upon, hearing this request, many in our government laughed him off, as if we would let a random foreigner into our government. However, King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] believes this can also be an oppurtunity to help the country modernize. Welcoming him as an advisor might help increase investment in our country and boost international relations, but would displease those in our government."
 dvg_beornia.13.a: "Let this guy do what he wants here. The more company the merrier!"
 dvg_beornia.13.b: "This guy is clearly a conman. Throw him out."
 
 dvg_beornia.14.t: "A Scandinavian Adventurer"
 dvg_beornia.14.d: "A man by the name of Lars Hayardal from Scandinavia has come to claim he can protect us from the Beornians and Inca."
 dvg_beornia.14.f: "He might be crazy, but many of our people are coming to like him. Maybe if Scandinavia can protect we can still preserve our independence to some degree."
 dvg_beornia.14.a: "All hail King Lars of Araucania!"
 
 dvg_beornia.15.t: "The Conman Returns!"
 dvg_beornia.15.d: "Seemingly disillusioned by not being able to join our government advisory, Lars Hayardal has gone south and managed to rally the Mapuche to resist our rule."
 dvg_beornia.15.f: "Many in our government are also shocked by the news of a delusional man of Scandinavian descent claiming to be the King of Mapuche. Contacts in our European embassies seem to know nothing of this man, while the official Scandinavian envoy to our nation says they are still in contact with the government in Scandinavia on how to deal with this situation."
 dvg_beornia.15.a: "Any obstacle to our expansion must be crushed."
 dvg_beornia.15.b: "All hail King Lars of Araucania!"
 
 dvg_beornia.16.t: "A Curious Family Reunion"
 dvg_beornia.16.d: "A rather bizarre story happened in Camelot as an Anglois explorer named Jean de Courtenay has been spreading some troubling rumors regarding our country's nobility."
 dvg_beornia.16.f: "He himself claims to be a lost relative of the Carter household and was here to visi this cousins. However, upon suggesting to Cattle Baron John Carter that his family are really the Courtenay who had survived the burning of Le Nouveau Havre in 1650, he was immediately thrown out of their house. This came as a surprise to most because the Carters were regarded as true Englishmen. \n\n However, this Courtenay fellow has seemingly legitimate-looking records that indicate he is in fact a relative of the Carters. Not only that, the records he brought with him seem to also be suggesting that the monarchs of our country were not originally from the noble House Cavendish of England, but instead just from some commoner farming family. This has questioned the legitimacy of the government in our country."
 dvg_beornia.16.a: "Let's hear more of what this man has to say."
 dvg_beornia.16.b: "What this guy is saying has no basis at all!"
 
 dvg_beornia.17.t: "Odonia Secedes!"
 dvg_beornia.17.d: "Although we have already ousted de Aigle from power, it seems another one of his relatives has seized power in the south of the country to stage some kind of family comeback."
 dvg_beornia.17.f: "It's unlikely this new wannabe dictator can do this on his own. The Beornians have openly declared their support and recognition of this secessionary state. We can try to take our sovereign territory back, but doing so would risk a war with Beornia and give them a justification to try and annex us too."
 dvg_beornia.17.a: "Tyrants are not welcome here, new or old!"
 dvg_beornia.17.b: "Meh, who needs Odonia anyway?"
 dvg_beornia.17.c: "The Beornians are right! Lotharingia has become too liberal and republican!"
 
 dvg_beornia.18.t: "The Declaration of the Holy Britannian Empire"
 dvg_beornia.18.d: "With [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] becoming a prominent power on the world stage, but still yet without having been able to retake England, its ruler has decided to take the country into a different direction, as King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] claims he has had a divine revelation."
 dvg_beornia.18.f: " In a widely broadcasted public speech, he tells the nation: 'I was on a short holiday in the Andes, where upon the ground collapsed beneath me and I fell into a cavern where I met an angel. She revealed to me a most vivid prophecy, where Anglo-Saxons win conflict after conflict with weapons and abilities I have never seen before; where English becomes THE international language and the sun never sets on our Empire!' \n\n Some speculate that this might be our king hallucinating from consuming psychedelic mushrooms on his trip, but nonetheless he has absolute authority and his ambitions can no longer be abated. He is now dead-set on world domination." 
 dvg_beornia.18.a: "All Hail Britannia!"
 
 dvg_beornia.19.t: "The Rise of the Holy Britannian Empire"
 dvg_beornia.19.d: "A new threat has emerge in the south of the Amerigan continent, in the form of a belligerent empire under a delusional ruler."
 dvg_beornia.19.f: "The newly self-proclaimed emperor of the 'Holy Britannian Empire' has announced his plans to conquer as much of the world as he possibly can. He has demanded that we relinquish our sovereignty and submit to his rule or face the wrath of an army with capabilities mankind has never seen before." 
 dvg_beornia.19.a: "What could he possibly be talking about? We can stop them!"
 dvg_beornia.19.b: "This threat sounds very real, we surrender!"
