 je_conquest_new_cornwall: "Conquest of the Southern Deserts"
 je_conquest_new_cornwall_reason: "The Kingdom of Beornia's southern border was marked by the river Graham after a treaty with the Mapuche Tribes whom resisted our earlier attempts at settling these lands. The Incans have laid bare their own ambitions to seize the Amerigan Cone so it has become a necessity for us to seize the southern deserts in the name of the crown before they or anyone else does."
 je_cattle_barons_wrath: "Disapproval of the King"
 je_cattle_barons_wrath_reason: "Due to his ambitions to reshape the country and change its course, King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] faces opposition from the more conservative and reactionary elements within the country, most prominent of them being the Cattle Barons." 
 je_cattle_barons_wrath_goal: "If King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] angers them to much, he risks getting ousted and replaced."

 conquest_new_cornwall.1.t: "Settling New Cornwall"
 conquest_new_cornwall.1.d: "We have completed our long campaign to conquer the lands christened New Cornwall. Settlers are beginning to seek out promising sites from which to establish new towns and exploit the region's natural resources."
 conquest_new_cornwall.1.f: "The Mapuche fought long and hard for centuries to protect their lands from us. Now at last they are defeated, and the lands of New Cornwall are indisputable ours. Now we must set ourselves to the task of populating and governing what we have won."
 conquest_new_cornwall.1.a: "Today New Cornwall, tomorrow the Cone!"

 dvg_beornia.1.t: "The English Monarchy in Exile"
 dvg_beornia.1.d: "Far away from its ancestral homeland, sits the only independent English-speaking country in the world."
 dvg_beornia.1.f: "Beornia is by all metrics the youngest nation in Ameriga as it was only claimed by English settlers in the 17th century crossing the Odon river, living in small towns often unknown by the Burgundian colonial administration. Over time, they developed a peculiar mindset of exiles distrustful of foreigners and keen to protect their language and culture with the wealthier among them being known as 'Cattle Barons'. \n\n One of these Cattle Barons, Harold Cavendish, claimed descent from the House Cavendish that once held the title of 'Duke of Newcastle'. His house was recognized to rule over these English-settled areas by the Burgundian authorities in 1709 for his efforts in destroying the Anglois settlement of Nouveau Havre that once inhabited the area. Now, with the Burgundians gone thanks to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] seeing the oppurtunity in helping Lotharingia's ruling class in their civil war and fight for independence, there are some in the government who seek to use this as a foundation to expand Beornia's influence further; whether it be annexing new lands or reclaiming old ones." 
 dvg_beornia.1.a: "Maybe one day more people will speak English."
 
 dvg_beornia.2.t: "Border Raids"
 dvg_beornia.2.d: "As Beornians expand the nation's frontiers, they often engages with conflict with indigenous people already living in the area."
 dvg_beornia.2.f: "To help facilitate these Beornian settlements, King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]'s uncle Prince Charles and his allies have been raiding villages on the outer reaches of our country.\n \n Some in the capital question if armed farmers and herdsmen armed with antiquated weapons dangerously close to the Inka Empire border is a wise idea, but these raiders have been seen as heroes by the local populace. Ordering these raids stop won't go well them."
 dvg_beornia.2.a: "These raids need to stop immediately. We should not risk a war with the Inkas and endangering lives."
 dvg_beornia.2.b: "Well you know what they say, survival of the fittest!"
 
 dvg_beornia.3.t: "Beornian Raiders"
 dvg_beornia.3.d: "Bands of Beornians are pillaging and razing villages near our border, infringing on our sovereignty and displacing our civilians."
 dvg_beornia.3.f: "Rumor has it that the one leading these raids is a Beornian prince, which could indicate these raids are state-sponsored too. Given our empire's history being cut down by a foreign power, are we just going to sit by and let the same thing happen again? "
 dvg_beornia.3.a: "We can't stand idly by as these savages brutalize our people. To arms! Destroy their pathetic excuse of a kingdom!"
 dvg_beornia.3.b: "Let's teach them a lesson and subjugate their country!"
 dvg_beornia.3.c: "We have other things to focus on."
 
 dvg_beornia.4.t: "Beornia's Immigration Policy"
 dvg_beornia.4.d: "Given the country's poor economic prospects and future ambitions, the issue of immigration policy has become a heated debate among the country's populace."
 dvg_beornia.4.f: "Unsurprisingly, the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('landowners_ig').GetName] want a stricter immigration policy to preserve their power, while members of our clergy believe we are stronger with more of our cutlure within our country. The Edwardian Circle by contrast think having an ample amount of labor regardless of culture would greatly improve our situation, though this would radicalize the other Beornians who will see this as dilluting our country and increased competition for land and employment."
 dvg_beornia.4.a: "Beornia for Beornians only! Close the border!"
 dvg_beornia.4.b: "We can use more people, but preferably those of our kind."
 dvg_beornia.4.c: "Beornia needs all the help it can get if it wants to prosper! Open the border!"
