 dvg_burgundy.1.t: "The 20th year of Mourning"
 dvg_burgundy.1.d: "This year marks the 20th anniversary of the death of Jean-Maximilien de Julich husband of Queen Anne. In the time since then, her heir, Jean, has become more active in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]'s politics."
 dvg_burgundy.1.f: "Betrothed early to ensure the close links of the principality of Jülich inside the Burgundian kingdom their couple was a happy one (a rare occurrence in royal families). Four sons were born of their union between 1810 and 1817 : Jean de Brabant, Charles-Joseph de Frise, Maximilien de Nevers, and Philippe de Flandre. \n\n  Alas the King-consort died while taking part in the battle of Cassel during the war of the 4th coalition against Wenceslaus V of Bohemia. Anne has taken the black of mourning ever since and her political role Maximilien de Nevers and Philippe de Flandre. Alas the King-consort died while taking part in the battle of Cassel during the war of the 4th coalition against Wenceslaus V of Bohemia. Anne has taken the black of mourning ever since and her political role has plummeted with most of the Royal powers taken by Parliament in her absence. While her father Joseph II still chose his own government Anne prefers to pray and live a reclusive life giving more and more powers to her heir Jean who is all but a Regent in name."
 dvg_burgundy.1.a: "Our thoughts and prayers with the Consort."

 dvg_burgundy.2.t: "Election of the Archbishop of Cologne"
 dvg_burgundy.2.d: "The tacit accord between the Papacy and Anvers has been for decades that the Burgundians would not intervene in the elections of the archbishoprics in exchange for rewarding loyal and quiet clergymen instead of politicians in Cologne and Mayence. However, the latest archbishop elected has been concerning to the Burgundian nobility."
 dvg_burgundy.2.f: "The election of the latest Primate of Germany had seen for example Karl von Wittelsbach-Zweibrücken elected a conservative nobleman who pose no threat to Burgundian rule. But in Cologne the Pope has recognized the election of Josephus von Elnere as archbishop. A popular figure in the Rhineland he had taken part in his youth in the Frankfurt assembly before leaving it when they infringed on the rights of the Church. Escaping to the Rhineland he has formed countless charities while preserving some of the spirit of the German revolution notably in his sermon of accession in which he has praised the Constitution of the Duchy of the Rhine and Liberal ideas..."
 dvg_burgundy.2.a: "We will watch him."

 dvg_burgundy.3.t: "Religious awakening in the Rhineland"
 dvg_burgundy.3.d: "Rhineland has always been a catholic bastion that the Reformation could not take down. With the recent increase in nationalist and liberal sentiments, there is a growing rift between the government of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] and its Rheinish subjects."
 dvg_burgundy.3.f: "When Philippe I of Burgundy broke with Rome in 1530 the Emperor formally protected the archbishops of the Rhine members of the Burgundian circle and this status quo endured with Catholic tolerated and their rights confirmed by the Charter of the Duchy of the Rhine. Now countless preachers formed in the Cologne seminary and sponsored by Von Elnere roam the countryside reinforcing the Catholic faith and converting hundreds of indecisive Protestants. The Rhineland is filled with religious fervour and in the most devout circles criticism of the religion of their legitimate sovereign has begun."
 dvg_burgundy.3.a: "Would the Rhenish stop already ?"

 dvg_burgundy.4.t: "Religious awakening in the Rhineland"

 dvg_burgundy.5.a: "Would the Rhenish stop already ?"

 dvg_burgundy.6.t: "The 1000th anniversary of the Treaties of Verdun"
 dvg_burgundy.6.d: "The Crown Prince Jean has made a remarkable visit to Verdun at the occasion of the 1000th anniversary of the treaty that saw the Carolingian empire split between the three sons of Louis the Pious. However, his words during the visit has fed into the alienation of the Catholic church and its followers."
 dvg_burgundy.6.f: "Jean,  a conservative and jingoist character has cultivated for years a 'link' to Lothar  the kings of Burgundy seeing themselves as his heirs since the inception of the Kingdom. Among the various platitudes and strange comparisons that his speech included one has caught the ears of Rhenish journalists : 'like in the days of Lothar we now see men of the Church conspire to break down the state. As Hincmar advised Charles the Bald we now see traitorous talks in the Catholic clergy hoping to separate the lands of the Rhine from their rightful sovereign. Burgundy will not suffer the fate of the kingdom of Lothar and this beautiful and mighty country shall stand once again united and strong'. These words caused an uproar in the Duchy of the Rhine but the Prince refused to renege on his words."
 dvg_burgundy.6.a: "Who cares what the Rhenish papists think?"

 dvg_burgundy.7.t: "The Union Bill"
 dvg_burgundy.7.d: "The personal union of the Duchy of the Rhine has caused problems for years."
 dvg_burgundy.7.f: "Many Dutch capitalists fear to invest in this industrial land because of the fact that the local government could change legislation or raise new taxes a right they were granted with the formation of the Duchy. Furthermore conservative circles fear that agitators are given too much freedom there and the military wants to have direct control over the Rhine fortifications the first line of defence of the Kingdom being shared with Rhenish troops that are widely distrusted by the General staff. There is thus a general will to act on the matter with a draft of a Union Act that would see the Rhenish people given the same rights as the rest of the people of the Kingdom with special articles protecting the Catholic faith while also ending the temporal powers of the high clergy. Some are calling for "One Kingdom on the Left Bank!""
 dvg_burgundy.7.a: "A kingdom that isn't united won't stand for long."
 dvg_burgundy.7.b: "Those problems will be worse if we try to do something."

 dvg_burgundy.8.t: "Failure of the Act of Union"
 dvg_burgundy.8.d: "As could be predicted Rhenish opposition was stiff towards the Burgundian bill. The Aachen assembly has vetoed the proposition while the archbishop of Cologne has decided to refuse any acts that would endanger the Rhenish situation and way of life."
 dvg_burgundy.8.f: "The Anvers Parliament could have forced the Bill but they would have needed the assent of the sovereign for this. Anne then refused to intervene fearing a new German revolt could threaten again the Kingdom and reassured the Rhenish angering many Parliamentarians and also her own heir who had expressed his support for the bill"
 dvg_burgundy.8.a: "Best to not upset the course of things "

 dvg_burgundy.9.t: "Success of the Act of Union"
 dvg_burgundy.9.d: "The Anvers Parliament has forced the Bill with the unexpected assent of the sovereign."
 dvg_burgundy.9.f: "As could be predicted Rhenish opposition was stiff towards the Burgundian bill. The Aachen assembly has tried to veto the proposition while the archbishop of Cologne has decided to refuse any acts that would endanger the Rhenish situation and way of life. Yet, critics have acknowledged fearing a new German revolt could threaten again the Kingdom, but supporters have reassured the Rhenish this will improve their standard of living in the long term and also her own heir who had expressed his support for the bill. "
 dvg_burgundy.9.a: "Best to not upset the course of things "

 dvg_burgundy.10.t: "The meeting of Cologne"
 dvg_burgundy.10.d: "Rumors have come from Cologne that Von Elnere would have met with the Revolutionary leader Hanno Tauber"
 dvg_burgundy.10.f: "Heir of the German revolutionaries the Burgundian state has suspected him of animating various conspiracies and liberal associations throughout the Rhineland but so far nothing conclusive has ever been uncovered. If this meeting has happened this could mean a lot for the political situation in the Duchy as both the Archbishops and Tauber could mobilize revolutionaries to free the Rhineland"
 dvg_burgundy.10.a: "We must watch the Rhineland even closer!"

 dvg_burgundy.11.t: "The Rhineland Revolt"
 dvg_burgundy.11.d: "The worst fears of the Burgundian government have come true : the Archbishop of Cologne has rallied the Duchy of the Rhine to revolt against the Queen in the hopes of forming an independent German liberal state."
 dvg_burgundy.11.f: "The failure of the Act of Union far from calming them only emboldened their opponents in the duchy who have grown in strenght with the Springtime of Nations. From the devout Catholics of the countryside to the revolutionary brotherhood of Hanno Tauber and the German nationalists all have rallied around the banner of the Archbishop calling for the end of Burgundian imperialism."
 dvg_burgundy.11.a: "Mobilize our troops we can't lose the Left Bank!"

 dvg_burgundy.12.a: "Mobilize our troops we can't lose the Left Bank!"

 dvg_burgundy.13.t: "Burgundians are coming"

 dvg_burgundy.13.f: "Let us rally the good folk of the Rhine around the holy banner of Cologne and cast the Burgundians out!"

 dvg_burgundy.15.a: "Freiheit und Brüderlichkeit!"

 dvg_burgundy.16.t: "The Rhineland Reconquest"
 dvg_burgundy.16.d: "The government of the Duchy of the Rhine has broken the Personal Union with the Burgundian kingdom and the Archbishop of Cologne has taken advantage of this to rally the Rhenish people under his rulegranting a liberal constitution and encouraging revolutions in Germany."
 dvg_burgundy.16.f: "This has prompted the Burgundians to mobilize their men to retake what they consider their rightful lands!"
 dvg_burgundy.16.a: "The Left Bank is ours!"

 dvg_burgundy.17.t: "The Act of Union"
 dvg_burgundy.17.d: "The end of the Duchy of the Rhine allowed the Burgundian parliament to eventually pass the Act of Union"
 dvg_burgundy.17.f: "The various privileges especially the ones related to the two archbishoprics were removed and the Burgundian police confiscated weapons all across the reoccupied lands. However the act also granted equal representation and voting rights to the people of Rhénanie along with a general amnesty for the revolutionaries that had taken arms at the exception of the archbishop von Elnere who died in exile several years later. The act also saw the reaffirmation of the anti-slavery stance of the Burgundian kingdom and many Liberals saw it as the proof of the transition to a truly Liberal and Constitutional Monarchy."
 dvg_burgundy.17.a: "One Kingdom one law!"
 
 dvg_burgundy.18.t: "The end of the Regency"
 dvg_burgundy.18.d: "The war against Jean united Republicans and Liberal Monarchists for a time but everyone knew that the issue of the form of the state would have to be resolved. "
 dvg_burgundy.18.f: "Charles-Joseph de Frise second son of Marie is in Finland and has renegated his claims to the Burgundian throne which is a sad affair as he would have been an excellent choice for all but the hardcore Republicans. Now Burgundy must choose between the continuation of the Monarchy with Maximilien de Hollande third son of Marie as a King devoid of power or declare the Republic. While Republicanism has surged because of the Civil War the Republicans are fiercely opposed by the nationalists who see them as Dutch and Jewish elements wanting to weaken Burgundy and these groups would be ready to use force to crush the radicals"
 dvg_burgundy.18.a: "All hail our new monarch Maximilien II!"
 dvg_burgundy.18.b: "Burgundy shall be a Republic!"
 dvg_burgundy.18.c: "Our nation must be purged of radicalism!"
