 dvg_burgundy.1.t: "The 20th year of Mourning"
 dvg_burgundy.1.d: "This year marks the 20th anniversary of the death of Jean-Maximilien de Julich husband of Queen Anne. In the time since then, her heir, Jean, has become more active in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]'s politics."
 dvg_burgundy.1.f: "Betrothed early to ensure the close links of the principality of Jülich inside the Burgundian kingdom their couple was a happy one (a rare occurrence in royal families). Four sons were born of their union between 1810 and 1817 : Jean de Brabant, Charles-Joseph de Frise, Maximilien de Nevers, and Philippe de Flandre. \n\n  Alas the King-consort died while taking part in the battle of Cassel during the war of the 4th coalition against Wenceslaus V of Bohemia. Anne has taken the black of mourning ever since and her political role Maximilien de Nevers and Philippe de Flandre. Alas the King-consort died while taking part in the battle of Cassel during the war of the 4th coalition against Wenceslaus V of Bohemia. Anne has taken the black of mourning ever since and her political role has plummeted with most of the Royal powers taken by Parliament in her absence. While her father Joseph II still chose his own government Anne prefers to pray and live a reclusive life giving more and more powers to her heir Jean who is all but a Regent in name."
 dvg_burgundy.1.a: "Our thoughts and prayers with the Consort."

 dvg_burgundy.2.t: "Election of the Archbishop of Cologne"
 dvg_burgundy.2.d: "The tacit accord between the Papacy and Anvers has been for decades that the Burgundians would not intervene in the elections of the archbishoprics in exchange for rewarding loyal and quiet clergymen instead of politicians in Cologne and Mayence. However, the latest archbishop elected has been concerning to the Burgundian nobility."
 dvg_burgundy.2.f: "The election of the latest Primate of Germany had seen for example Karl von Wittelsbach-Zweibrücken elected a conservative nobleman who pose no threat to Burgundian rule. But in Cologne the Pope has recognized the election of Josephus von Elnere as archbishop. A popular figure in the Rhineland he had taken part in his youth in the Frankfurt assembly before leaving it when they infringed on the rights of the Church. Escaping to the Rhineland he has formed countless charities while preserving some of the spirit of the German revolution notably in his sermon of accession in which he has praised the Constitution of the Duchy of the Rhine and Liberal ideas..."
 dvg_burgundy.2.a: "We will watch him."

 dvg_burgundy.3.t: "Religious awakening in the Rhineland"
 dvg_burgundy.3.d: "Rhineland has always been a catholic bastion that the Reformation could not take down. With the recent increase in nationalist and liberal sentiments, there is a growing rift between the government of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] and its Rheinish subjects."
 dvg_burgundy.3.f: "When Philippe I of Burgundy broke with Rome in 1530 the Emperor formally protected the archbishops of the Rhine members of the Burgundian circle and this status quo endured with Catholic tolerated and their rights confirmed by the Charter of the Duchy of the Rhine. Now countless preachers formed in the Cologne seminary and sponsored by Von Elnere roam the countryside reinforcing the Catholic faith and converting hundreds of indecisive Protestants. The Rhineland is filled with religious fervour and in the most devout circles criticism of the religion of their legitimate sovereign has begun."
 dvg_burgundy.3.a: "Would the Rhenish stop already ?"

 dvg_burgundy.4.t: "Religious awakening in the Rhineland"
 dvg_burgundy.4.d: "Rhineland has always been a catholic bastion that the Reformation could not take down. With the recent increase in nationalist and liberal sentiments, there is a growing rift between the government of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] and its Rheinish subjects."
 dvg_burgundy.4.f: "When Philippe I of Burgundy broke with Rome in 1530 the Emperor formally protected the archbishops of the Rhine members of the Burgundian circle and this status quo endured with Catholic tolerated and their rights confirmed by the Charter of the Duchy of the Rhine. Now countless preachers formed in the Cologne seminary and sponsored by Von Elnere roam the countryside reinforcing the Catholic faith and converting hundreds of indecisive Protestants. The Rhineland is filled with religious fervour and in the most devout circles criticism of the religion of their legitimate sovereign has begun."
 dvg_burgundy.4.a: "Would the Rhenish stop already ?"
 
 dvg_burgundy.5.t: "Religious awakening in the Rhineland"
 dvg_burgundy.5.d: "Rhineland has always been a catholic bastion that the Reformation could not take down. With the recent increase in nationalist and liberal sentiments, there is a growing rift between the government of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] and its Rheinish subjects."
 dvg_burgundy.5.f: "When Philippe I of Burgundy broke with Rome in 1530 the Emperor formally protected the archbishops of the Rhine members of the Burgundian circle and this status quo endured with Catholic tolerated and their rights confirmed by the Charter of the Duchy of the Rhine. Now countless preachers formed in the Cologne seminary and sponsored by Von Elnere roam the countryside reinforcing the Catholic faith and converting hundreds of indecisive Protestants. The Rhineland is filled with religious fervour and in the most devout circles criticism of the religion of their legitimate sovereign has begun."
 dvg_burgundy.5.a: "Would the Rhenish stop already ?"

 dvg_burgundy.6.t: "The 1000th anniversary of the Treaties of Verdun"
 dvg_burgundy.6.d: "The Crown Prince Jean has made a remarkable visit to Verdun at the occasion of the 1000th anniversary of the treaty that saw the Carolingian empire split between the three sons of Louis the Pious. However, his words during the visit has fed into the alienation of the Catholic church and its followers."
 dvg_burgundy.6.f: "Jean,  a conservative and jingoist character has cultivated for years a 'link' to Lothar  the kings of Burgundy seeing themselves as his heirs since the inception of the Kingdom. Among the various platitudes and strange comparisons that his speech included one has caught the ears of Rhenish journalists : 'like in the days of Lothar we now see men of the Church conspire to break down the state. As Hincmar advised Charles the Bald we now see traitorous talks in the Catholic clergy hoping to separate the lands of the Rhine from their rightful sovereign. Burgundy will not suffer the fate of the kingdom of Lothar and this beautiful and mighty country shall stand once again united and strong'. These words caused an uproar in the Duchy of the Rhine but the Prince refused to renege on his words."
 dvg_burgundy.6.a: "Who cares what the Rhenish papists think?"

 dvg_burgundy.7.t: "The Union Bill"
 dvg_burgundy.7.d: "The personal union of the Duchy of the Rhine has caused problems for years."
 dvg_burgundy.7.f: "Many Dutch capitalists fear to invest in this industrial land because of the fact that the local government could change legislation or raise new taxes a right they were granted with the formation of the Duchy. Furthermore conservative circles fear that agitators are given too much freedom there and the military wants to have direct control over the Rhine fortifications the first line of defence of the Kingdom being shared with Rhenish troops that are widely distrusted by the General staff. There is thus a general will to act on the matter with a draft of a Union Act that would see the Rhenish people given the same rights as the rest of the people of the Kingdom with special articles protecting the Catholic faith while also ending the temporal powers of the high clergy. Some are calling for "One Kingdom on the Left Bank!""
 dvg_burgundy.7.a: "A kingdom that isn't united won't stand for long."
 dvg_burgundy.7.b: "Those problems will be worse if we try to do something."

 dvg_burgundy.8.t: "Failure of the Act of Union"
 dvg_burgundy.8.d: "As could be predicted Rhenish opposition was stiff towards the Burgundian bill. The Aachen assembly has vetoed the proposition while the archbishop of Cologne has decided to refuse any acts that would endanger the Rhenish situation and way of life."
 dvg_burgundy.8.f: "The Anvers Parliament could have forced the Bill but they would have needed the assent of the sovereign for this. Anne then refused to intervene fearing a new German revolt could threaten again the Kingdom and reassured the Rhenish angering many Parliamentarians and also her own heir who had expressed his support for the bill"
 dvg_burgundy.8.a: "Best to not upset the course of things "

 dvg_burgundy.9.t: "Success of the Act of Union"
 dvg_burgundy.9.d: "The Anvers Parliament has forced the Bill with the unexpected assent of the sovereign."
 dvg_burgundy.9.f: "As could be predicted Rhenish opposition was stiff towards the Burgundian bill. The Aachen assembly has tried to veto the proposition while the archbishop of Cologne has decided to refuse any acts that would endanger the Rhenish situation and way of life. Yet, critics have acknowledged fearing a new German revolt could threaten again the Kingdom, but supporters have reassured the Rhenish this will improve their standard of living in the long term and also her own heir who had expressed his support for the bill. "
 dvg_burgundy.9.a: "Best to not upset the course of things "

 dvg_burgundy.10.t: "The meeting of Cologne"
 dvg_burgundy.10.d: "Rumors have come from Cologne that Von Elnere would have met with the Revolutionary leader Hanno Tauber"
 dvg_burgundy.10.f: "Heir of the German revolutionaries the Burgundian state has suspected him of animating various conspiracies and liberal associations throughout the Rhineland but so far nothing conclusive has ever been uncovered. If this meeting has happened this could mean a lot for the political situation in the Duchy as both the Archbishops and Tauber could mobilize revolutionaries to free the Rhineland"
 dvg_burgundy.10.a: "We must watch the Rhineland even closer!"

 dvg_burgundy.11.t: "The Rhineland Revolt"
 dvg_burgundy.11.d: "The worst fears of the Burgundian government have come true : the Archbishop of Cologne has rallied the Duchy of the Rhine to revolt against the Queen in the hopes of forming an independent German liberal state."
 dvg_burgundy.11.f: "The failure of the Act of Union far from calming them only emboldened their opponents in the duchy who have grown in strenght with the Springtime of Nations. From the devout Catholics of the countryside to the revolutionary brotherhood of Hanno Tauber and the German nationalists all have rallied around the banner of the Archbishop calling for the end of Burgundian imperialism."
 dvg_burgundy.11.a: "Mobilize our troops we can't lose the Left Bank!"

 dvg_burgundy.12.t: "The Rhineland Revolt"
 dvg_burgundy.12.d: "The worst fears of the Burgundian government have come true : the Archbishop of Cologne has rallied the Duchy of the Rhine to revolt against the Queen in the hopes of forming an independent German liberal state."
 dvg_burgundy.12.f: "The failure of the Act of Union far from calming them only emboldened their opponents in the duchy who have grown in strenght with the Springtime of Nations. From the devout Catholics of the countryside to the revolutionary brotherhood of Hanno Tauber and the German nationalists all have rallied around the banner of the Archbishop calling for the end of Burgundian imperialism."
 dvg_burgundy.12.a: "Mobilize our troops we can't lose the Left Bank!"

 dvg_burgundy.13.t: "Burgundians are coming"
 dvg_burgundy.13.d: "We have revolted for freedom and catholicism against Burgundy!"
 dvg_burgundy.13.f: "Let us rally the good folk of the Rhine around the holy banner of Cologne and cast the Burgundians out!"
 dvg_burgundy.13.a: "Freiheit und Brüderlichkeit!"

 dvg_burgundy.14.t: "Burgundians are coming"
 dvg_burgundy.14.d: "We have revolted for freedom and catholicism against Burgundy!"
 dvg_burgundy.14.f: "Let us rally the good folk of the Rhine around the holy banner of Cologne and cast the Burgundians out!"

 dvg_burgundy.14.a: "Freiheit und Brüderlichkeit!"
 dvg_burgundy.15.t: "Burgundians are coming"
 dvg_burgundy.15.d: "We have revolted for freedom and catholicism against Burgundy!"
 dvg_burgundy.15.f: "Let us rally the good folk of the Rhine around the holy banner of Cologne and cast the Burgundians out!"
 dvg_burgundy.15.a: "Freiheit und Brüderlichkeit!"

 dvg_burgundy.16.t: "The Rhineland Reconquest"
 dvg_burgundy.16.d: "The government of the Duchy of the Rhine has broken the Personal Union with the Burgundian kingdom and the Archbishop of Cologne has taken advantage of this to rally the Rhenish people under his rulegranting a liberal constitution and encouraging revolutions in Germany."
 dvg_burgundy.16.f: "This has prompted the Burgundians to mobilize their men to retake what they consider their rightful lands!"
 dvg_burgundy.16.a: "The Left Bank is ours!"

 dvg_burgundy.17.t: "The Act of Union"
 dvg_burgundy.17.d: "The end of the Duchy of the Rhine allowed the Burgundian parliament to eventually pass the Act of Union"
 dvg_burgundy.17.f: "The various privileges especially the ones related to the two archbishoprics were removed and the Burgundian police confiscated weapons all across the reoccupied lands. However the act also granted equal representation and voting rights to the people of Rhénanie along with a general amnesty for the revolutionaries that had taken arms at the exception of the archbishop von Elnere who died in exile several years later. The act also saw the reaffirmation of the anti-slavery stance of the Burgundian kingdom and many Liberals saw it as the proof of the transition to a truly Liberal and Constitutional Monarchy."
 dvg_burgundy.17.a: "One Kingdom one law!"
 
 dvg_burgundy.18.t: "The Anvers Revolution"
 dvg_burgundy.18.d: "In order to accomodate the demands of the liberals, a new resolution was adopted in the country's capital city."
 dvg_burgundy.18.f: "In her many years of service Queen Anne’s contributions to the history of Burgundy were already destined to be remembered in the future. But today she signed a new and unprecedented constitution into law across the Burgundian lands: The overwhelmingly strengthened liberal faction of the Parliament has coerced the queen under the threat of “other means” to enshrine universal voting and the end of the slave trade across the realm among other such radical reforms which angered the political heir-apparent and Duke of Brabant Jean beyond reason. In a haphazardly written manifesto he decried the nerve to pressure his grieving and sick mother into enforcing such ridiculous demands which threaten to tear apart the fabric of the proud Burgundian society. Unsurprisingly this too caused outrage among the liberals as a politically active soon-to-be monarch is indeed a dire threat to their cause."
 dvg_burgundy.18.a: "Jean de Brabant is a problem."

 dvg_burgundy.19.t: "The Death of Queen Anne"
 dvg_burgundy.19.d: "The queen of Burgundy Anne II of Cleves-Valois-Bourgogne has died yesterday in her country mansion in Eupen. A devout and retired monarch she was seen as a figure of unity by the population although not many truly loved her"
 dvg_burgundy.19.f: "As the funerary convoy passed through the cities of Central Burgundy to be buried in Anvers with her late husband many noticed that it was her last son Philippe of Flanders that led the procession rather than her heir Jean. It was no secret that tensions and divisions marked the royal family as the Queen resented the affirmed and oppposite personnalities of both the Reactionary heir and her Liberal second son."
 dvg_burgundy.19.a: "At least she joins her beloved in their mausoleum!"

 dvg_burgundy.20.t: "The coronation of Jean VI"
 dvg_burgundy.20.d: "Now tha"
 dvg_burgundy.20.f: "A few days after the official funeral of the late Queen, Anvers was preparing for the new coronation of the King. As the ritual dictates the King enters Saint Michael's Abbey where the Archbishop of Anvers demands him an oath to protect the Realm the Faith and cause Justice for his subjects. Following this the King is annointed like the Kings of Israël. From this coronation emerged Jean VI of Burgundy acclaimed by the crowds of Anvers. Foreign journalists witnessed some opposition to this joyous occasion notably from Liberal students that were however soon disposed by the police before being able to disturb the procession."
 dvg_burgundy.20.a: "Dei Gratia Rex"

 dvg_burgundy.21.t: "The Address to Parliament"
 dvg_burgundy.21.d: "The Sovereign of Burgundy opens and closes Parliament and even the late Queen Anne did her duty although always following the advice of her Prime Minister."
 dvg_burgundy.21.f: "Jean VI however had a different mind on the royal function. As the members of the two Houses gathered to hear his speech he proclaimed that he had sworn to protect the people of Burgundy and that he would take a more important role in politics compared to his mother. His will was not to infringe on the rights bestowed to his subjects by his predecessors but only to exert his rights and duties as King of Burgundy. While the members of Parliament applauded the speech as the custom dictated the malaise felt by many was apparent."
 dvg_burgundy.21.a: "What does it mean for Burgundy ?"

 dvg_burgundy.22.t: "The Pinto Affair"
 dvg_burgundy.22.d: "The end of the Duchy of the Rhine allowed the Burgundian parliament to eventually pass the Act of Union"
 dvg_burgundy.22.f: "François de Pinto was a member of the East Indies Company who was in charge of lobbying members of Parliament in favor of the company. This year, he became the centre of a mediatic affair as corruption of members of Parliament was revealed by the Conservative newspaper 'Le Temps'. This was a blow to the Liberals since most of the members that had received bribes through da Pinto were of their faction and the number of laws protecting the interests of the Duch-based company provoked popular discontent throughout the Southern lands of Burgundy. As the son of a converted Jew Da Pinto was a perfect target for the newspaper and was soon forced to flee Burgundy because of the many threats he received"
 dvg_burgundy.22.a: "The V.O.C must be reigned in!"

 dvg_burgundy.23.t: "The Anti-Corruption Bill"
 dvg_burgundy.23.d: "Following the Pinto Affair, Conservative members of the Upper House proposed a bill that aimed to reduce the lobbying towards members of Parliament."
 dvg_burgundy.23.f: "This move was not a disinterested one : the Upper House was filled with nobles who had ties to the industries and foreign trade but never were lobbied like the Member of the Lower House. It was soon clear to many that the law while proposed by the Upper House had been drafted by the King who intented to play a role in politics. Even though the popular opinion was overwhelmingly in favor of the bill. The lower house rejected it declaring that current laws were sufficient to prevent another Pinto affair"
 dvg_burgundy.23.a: "What is this masquerade ?"

 dvg_burgundy.24.t: "The King's Speech"
 dvg_burgundy.24.d: "After the failure of the anti-corruption bill the King proposed a new bill on the subject with himself entering parliament to give a speech on it, in which he declares the dissolution of parliament."
 dvg_burgundy.24.f: " "It has become clear over the past couple of months that nobody in this entire institute that claims to represent the Burgundian people actually represents them. This Chamber houses nothing but the representatives of the interests of industrialists, merchants of money and the destructive forces of modernism. If no single man here is willing to defend the common people of this kingdom from these interests as you were willing to show again with the vote of this afternoon duty falls upon the oldest institute of our kingdom to do what this chamber has failed to do. Is it not the institute of king that bound by blood and rooted in our soil represents our nation's past as her tradition our nation's present as her voice and our nation's future as her hope ? It is because of this weight on my shoulders that I have decided to in my due right as king to dissolve the current session of Parliament until new elections have been called and a new parliament can take place in this chamber. Gentlemen you're free to go home."  "
 dvg_burgundy.24.a: "Is this the beginning of the crisis?"

 dvg_burgundy.25.t: "The State Language Act"
 dvg_burgundy.25.d: "Burgundy has been a pluricultural state for centuries with Dutch and German accepted in their territories while the Burgundian language this hybrid Oil language codified by the Royal Academy from Bourguignon, Walton, Lorrain, and countless Dutch and Flemish influences was always the primary language of the state."
 dvg_burgundy.25.f: "Now in these times of uncertainties Germanophobia is again a powerful force in politics and a group of moderates (deputies who are not in the Royal or Parliamentarian faction) have pushed for a unified language act that would abolish the teaching and the use of German Dutch and Frisian in Burgundian public institutions. While it has the support of the majority of the House whose members speak the purest Burgundian form of Anvers it could rekindle the fires of revolt in Rhineland. A radical faction has even proposed not to repel this act and maintain the status quo but to use this law to grant more language autonomy to the Germanic regions as to ensure their loyalty."
 dvg_burgundy.25.a: "Un Royaume une langue!"
 dvg_burgundy.25.b: "We don't need to change anything."
 dvg_burgundy.25.c: "Using their language won't change much, grant them autonomy."



 dvg_burgundy.26.t: "The trial of Johan von Bosse"
 dvg_burgundy.26.d: "In the Pinto affair one deputy was largely attacked the self-proclaimed Republican Johan van Bosse."
 dvg_burgundy.26.f: "A controversial figure in Burgundy throughout the years he only avoided conviction by royal authorities because of his elections to the Chamber and the large popular support he enjoys in Bruges. But the various bribes he took from the V.O.C has eroded his position and he lost his seat in the latest election. Now he faces a trial that is very much piloted by the Monarchy as the judge is a renowned Jeannist partisan. What will happen to the Republican of Bruges ?"
 dvg_burgundy.26.a: "He shall be freed."
 dvg_burgundy.26.b: "He shall be convicted."


 dvg_burgundy.27.t: "The death of Philippe Rickwaert"
 dvg_burgundy.27.d: "For months the duke of Ligny Saint-Pol a close friend from King Jean had threatened journalists from the radical newspaper 'Le libre Luxembourgeois' to stop attacking the king. One of those journalists has now met an untimely end."
 dvg_burgundy.27.f: "A prominent nobleman in Luxembourg and a vocal critic of the Burgundian Parliament he soon became the new focus of Philippe Rickwaert the owner of the paper who revealed the various affairs the duke entertained with women of little virtue throughout his various estates and properties. The duke challenged him to a duel that Rickwaert refused and then descended to Luxembourg where he shot the journalist to the death. This affair has rallied the radicals who have gathered in thousands for the burial of Rickwaert but the King can hardly let one of his supporters go in these times of need. The court packed with Parliamentarians (if one believes the Jeannist newspapers) has declared the duke guilty but the King can still pardon him."
 dvg_burgundy.27.a: "The King will pardon his friend."
 dvg_burgundy.27.b: "The judgment will stay as is."

 dvg_burgundy.28.t: "The Walloon Crisis"
 dvg_burgundy.28.d: "What was once unthinkable has happened: the Estates Generale has stood against our King demanding major concessions in the Wallonian region."
 dvg_burgundy.28.f: "In an interesting turn of events a relatively minor law in the Burgundian Estates Generale the law itself concering minor matters of Administration in Wallonian has snowballed into a major crisis point for the Political system of our nation. Allowing the Estates to get away with this could soothe tensions in the nation albeit giving administrative concessions in wallonia to the Parlimentarists which could undermine our authority in the eyes of the people. If the King forced the Parliment to accept his demands it could anger the people but give more political power to the Monarchy"
 dvg_burgundy.28.a: "The King allows the Estates Generale to have the concessions."
 dvg_burgundy.28.b: "The King forces the Estates Gernerale to accept his will."

dvg_burgundy.29.t: "The Arsenal of the Burgundian Navy"
dvg_burgundy.29.d: "The development of the capital has increased the problem of silting and many fear that the works needed to maintain the military port and prevent problems in the Escaut would be too much to pay"
dvg_burgundy.29.f: "The port of Anvers is the main port of the Kingdom and one of the biggest and more active in the world. Rotterdam on the other hand poses no such problem and is directly linked to the Rhine the main artery of commerce of Burgundy. Thus the Parliament has envisioned to transfer much of the military facilities away from Anvers to Rotterdam causing uproar in the capital as the arsenal is one of the biggest employers of the city. The King profited from this to take the defence of the capital and this subject has become another divide between the Royals and the Parliamentarians."
dvg_burgundy.29.a: "Rotterdam is best for the long term interests of Burgundy do not listen to the rabble!"
dvg_burgundy.29.b: "The King vetoes the law : the Navy stays in Anvers."

dvg_burgundy.30.t: "De Broglie"
dvg_burgundy.30.d: "A ranked general in the Army he also is seen as a capable administrator leading the Parti Royaliste in the Upper House. Since the times of Joseph II (1790-1817)."
dvg_burgundy.30.f: "Lately the removed-cousin of the King Antoine de Broglie has gotten the ear of the King The Prime Minister has always come from the winner party in elections but nothing legally forces the King to do so"
dvg_burgundy.30.a: "De Broglie will form a government"
dvg_burgundy.30.b: "We must not upset the unwritten laws of the Kingdom"

 dvg_burgundy.100.f: "Pierlot has proven himself to be a competent administrator.
