 # CAL1.T;The Situation of Quito;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL1.D;The Viceroyalty of Cisandina has always existed apart from the rest of the Spanish New World. Seized from Tawantinsuyu ages ago, Spanish colonization has only truly been carried out in the urban areas around the north, near the cities of Quito and Guayaquil. Independence fighters from Quito, most notably the warlord Martin Ballivián (known to his adversaries as “El Podenco”), participated in a raid on the Inca capital of Cusco, sacking the city. In retaliation Washkar Inca led an army northwards, rampaging all the way to Chan Chan before Dom Henrique Tupac Cuzi de Ingapirca y Alfaoes, duke of Tupac Cuzi de Ingapirca, rallied a multi-ethnic army of indigenous warriors and Spanish-descended settlers to repel the Inca. The Duke of Tupac was made Viceroy of the colony for his efforts, but the years since then have seen Quitenese politics snarl in unfamiliar directions. Rumors of secret societies run rife around the colony, and figures around the realm may be making plans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL1.A;Dreaming of riches, not in a position to make a difference…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL35.T;The House of Tupac;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL35.D;Tawantinsuyu, the Inca Empire, had a civil war in the seventeenth century. The Inca claimant with ties to the Chim nobility Paullu Tupac Cuzi controlled Chinchaysuyu (the northwestern half of the empire), but sought an edge over his rival, Sayri Amaru. He thus made the dangerous gamble of asking the Spanish Empire for aid, promising vague concessions if he prevailed. Sensing an opportunity, the Spanish agreed. Some say Paullu simply stalemated Amaru, others that the Spanish sabotaged him, but eventually Spain seized control of Chinchaysuyu. The first Duke of Tupac-Cuzi (often referred to simply as Tupac) was created in 1701 by King Joao III, who awarded the title to the grandson of Paullu Tupac. The Dukes took up residence in Spain and married into European Spanish nobility. The current Duke’s father was the Director of the Golden Board of Atlantia from 1810 to 1820, causing the family to return to the continent. The Duke’s tenure as Viceroy has led to most of his family joining him in their old Chimu estates.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL35.A;Back to the West Coast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL2.T;La Sociedad de Carmelistas;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL2.D;When Spanish King Pedro III crushed Jose II’s liberals with Anglois assistance in 1815, the liberal revolutionaries of the Sociedad de Carmelistas fled abroad. They arrived in Quito in 1816 but failed to gain traction and dissolved by the 1820s. Now Manuel Sandino, an exile from western Spain, has founded a new Sociedad de Carmelistas. The Carmelistas are a group of Utopian liberals who are committed to many radical causes. They demand the subordination of the military to civilian leadership, wishing to strengthen the armed forces only insofar as they defend democracy. Carmelistas support a strong, centralized, secular, and protectionist government, but one confident enough to be able to devolve power onto local communities in certain cases. Strangest of all is their “Quitenese Dream,” which holds that Quito represents the synthesis of Andean and European civilization, the only foundation upon which true democracy can be built. While current laws force them to organize in secret they may pose a problem in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL2.A;How bizarre.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL3.T;El Amigo del Pueblo;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL3.D;El Amigo del Pueblo is one of the most prominent newspapers in Quito, published by radical author Clodio Magno Puma Muyuroney. Unlike many other papers, which cater to the conservative aristocracy, El Amigo del Pueblo is a liberal-leaning newspaper with growing popularity among the small but notable Quitenese middle class. While our administration can certainly appreciate a diversity of viewpoints, the newspaper’s recent editorials have brought sharp criticism against the regime. They have criticized the Duke as being a “subservient appendage of Lisbon,” accusing him of courting public support yet remaining loyal to the upper classes and the aristocracy. Many of the articles are skirting Quitenese laws on supporting seditious groups. Quite a few upper class friends of the Duke of Tupac have urged him to shut the paper down, but he demurred, remaining aloof as to how he intended to respond.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL3.A;Will those liars see the penitentiary, or will they stay free?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL34.T;Rumors About Mururoney;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL34.D;News of the Carmelista secret society is hard to come by, but we believe they have undergone a change in leadership. The rising fame of El Amigo del Pueblo has brought equal fame to its proprietor, Muyuroney. It seems that the Carmelistas see him as more ambitious, confident, and passionate than Sandino. The latter remains a force within the movement, especially among its more moderate elements, but Muyuroney’s star appears ascendant. If rumors are to be believed, Muyuroney may have assumed leadership of the society itself, or at least eclipsed Sandino as its figurehead. While nothing is certain and both men still cannot be legally proven to be Carmelistas, what Sociedad communications we’ve identified speak of Muyuroney with newfound importance and mention Sandino far less often. This is rather concerning, as whereas Sandino was a more typical liberal ideologue, Muyuroney is a radical firebrand who has been fined for libel multiple times and just barely avoids imprisonment for seditious language.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL34.A;Just more gossip.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL4.T;”An Open Letter to the Carmelist Gentlemen”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL4.D;In response to recent articles in El Amigo del Pueblo criticizing the viceroy, the Duke of Tupac has published a pamphlet countering the charges made against him by the liberals. Defending his record of “acting with fidelity as the obedient servant of all Quiteneses,” the Duke has denigrated the Carmelitas as being “overcome by delusions of grandeur,” “ensconced within ivory towers or candlelit basements,” and “utterly out of touch with the actual condition of the people and their needs…in short, mere romantics.” In contrast, the Duke writes, he and his loyalists represent “the only realistic course of the Quitenese government, one which responds to the condition of the nation and its people as they are, rather than as one may imagine them to be.” While the pamphlet has bolstered his support among the less radical elements of the population, it also seems to have backfired. Muyuroney has recently published an article in which the society he allegedly leads was for the first time referred to as the “Romanticos.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL4.A;Well, then, let the Duke’s loyalists be true realists - Los Realistas!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL5.T;The Duke visits Chan Chan;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL5.D;The Viceroy Dom Henrique has visited Chan Chan, capital of the Cajamarca province and home of the Chimu people. The city saw heavy fighting during the Battle of Chan Chan, also known as the ?Battle of the Army of the Volunteers? owing to the multi-ethnic nature of the ad hoc army which the Duke rallied against Washkar Inca. The Chimu have a bitter history with Tawantinsuyu : they were rivals before being conquered by the legendary Inca emperor Pachacuti. When Spain undertook the Third Andine War in 1662, the Chimu defected in exchange for political privileges which they still enjoy because of the continuing warfare in the Andes. Most of the Chimu nobility, having married Criollo heiresses and converted to Christianity have been loyal to Spanish rule but they still cultivate a distinct identity as the 'noblest hidalgos of the continent'. The visit was seen as an effort to court the support of local lords against the Romanticos, with many veterans saluting the viceroy in memory of the victory he secured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL5.A;The Duke needs all of the friends that he can find, these days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL6.T;Dom Wilka’s Society;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL6.D;Dom José Amerigo de Willka y Chanchan comes from one of the highest Chimu noble families. Hereditary corregidor of the province of Cajamarca as all the Willkas since the Spanish conquest, José Amerigo took part in the defense of Chan-Chan alongside his father who died in the battle. Ever since, he has become rather infamous for his Republican views in contrast with the rest of the nobility. With the Duke of Tupac now openly courting the support of the Chimu nobility against the Romanticos, Dom Wilka has decided to go public with his support of the Romantico cause.  In defiance of the national ban on the Romanticos' societies, he has officiated the opening of a society chapter in Chan-Chan! Unfortunately, the Dom is a popular man, and we cannot simply imprison him for this act. Furthermore he appears to be more moderate than the Quitenese Liberals so for now, we must keep an eye out for whoever comes forward to join said society and hope that he causes friction with Muyuroney and Sadino.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL6.A;If he wants to pick a fight with the Viceroy, he should just say so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL7.T;The Plan of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL7.D;The threat of the Spanish and the Inca has caused the unthinkable : The Duke of Tupac, Sandino, and Muyuroney have formed an alliance! All three have gathered in Quito, in conditions of great secrecy but which was rumored to be anything from a plan to kill the duke to a ploy to arrest the entire Romantico leadership. Instead, a stunning proclamation was issued in which the three political titans explained their intentions to join forces to protect Quito. Already, the Duke has confirmed the “total extinction” of any remaining ties to the Spanish crown. Several Romantico militias have already emerged from hiding to bolster the ranks of the existing military. While many doubt that this partnership can last any longer than is absolutely necessary, so long as they collaborate it seems like they might be able to unite the nation behind them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL7.A;¡Por Unidad!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL8.T;Choosing a Generalissimo;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL8.D;If we are to effectively lead an armed revolution then we must decide who shall command our forces. While all three members of the ruling triumvirate are in theory equal, Sandino was only included to keep the Romanticos united and has little military experience. Thus we must choose between the Duke of Tupac and Muyuroney. The Duke of Tupac’s charisma and excellent strategic and tactical mind is unquestioned, but he is still an aristocrat and vesting such power in him could be dangerous for our democracy. Muyuroney is less skilled, though still somewhat adept at offensive operations, and is a committed foe of monarchism, but is also conceited and vain. It is questionable if he could inspire the same confidence and loyalty as a general that he did as an author.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL8.A;All eyes on Tupac!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL8.B;Muyuroney augurs better for our democratic future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL9.T;The Manner of Promotion;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL9.D;Our revolutionary army is taking shape but we need to establish how its men should be able to rise through the ranks. The Duke of Tupac, yielding to the vast liberal pressure amongst the coalition, has proposed that lower-rank officers be elected by their own soldiers, while higher-rank officers be promoted based upon their performance in the field. Though the Duke sees this as a compromise, it has unnerved the Romanticists, who are cognizant of the many incidents in history when revolutionary generals leveraged their reputations into seizing power. Thus they have proposed that revolutionary committees and their delegates  be the ones to monitor officers’ performance and recommend promotions, for the military high command to be democratically elected, and for civilians to be able to withdraw said commissions by recall vote. This system would be more resistant to tyranny and corruption but it would make Romantico values the army’s standard of conduct.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL9.A;Fortune favors the bold and so shall we!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL9.B;We cannot risk any Caesars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL10.T;The Question of the Curacas;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL10.D;The curacas of Chimu and other coastal areas in Quito were formerly Inca magistrates who ruled ayllus, imperial family units, serving various roles such as tax collectors and priests. When Spain conquered the northern section of the Inca Empire, the curacas were allowed to keep significant privileges in exchange for assisting the administration. Now some have suggested folding the curacas into its command structure, since curacas, like all Inca nobles, were expected to be military leaders and many have served in our army in the past. This would strengthen our influence among native groups and increase our manpower, but to win their loyalty we would likely have to confirm their old privileges. The Romanticos may value Andean culture as part of the Quitenese identity, but they see the curacas as remnants of the old regimes which must be swept away. Therefore they have urged that we instead work to bring the curacas’ subjects into the army without their old lords, cultivating democracy and republicanism amongst the native peoples.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL10.A;Welcome these honorable men into our ranks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL10.B;Liberty, not aristocracy, must animate the army.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL11.T;The Coalition Dissolves;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL11.D;The triumvirate of Tupac, Sandino, and Muyuroney has finally fallen apart. Fissions are wracking the military and the civilian administration, and people throughout the nation are now taking sides. While outsiders might see these political issues as merely a binary divide between Realistas and Romanticos, in truth the Romanticos are also divided between Muyuroney’s loyalists and the liberal remnants of Sandino’s supporters. It would be far easier for Muyuroney to take power by making concessions to the less radical Romanticos rather than attempt to rule unopposed. Meanwhile, the Duke of Tupac seeks to put an end to the Romantico threat for good and consolidate power as an unrestricted leader of Quito. It soon becomes clear that the winner of the struggle is none other than…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL11.A;To the victor the spoils!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL11.B;Muyuroney and the liberal Romanticos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL11.C;§RMuyuroney, unbound and unfettered!§;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL12.T;The End of the Quitenese Assembly;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL12.D;The Duke wasted no time smashing the Romanticos once he had enough military and civilian personnel loyal to him. Sandino and Muyuroney were both executed for treason, and many of their compatriots are heading into prisons and graves across the nation. Some of these men resisted. Some of these men will never resist again. While the surviving Romanticos have gone back underground, the organization has been dealt a severe blow. Not satisfied with the crushing of his main rivals, the duke decided to put an end to representative democracy entirely. In an announcement before the Cortes Nacionale in Quito, he dissolved the assembly, and postponed elections to compose the new assembly “indefinitely.” Rumor has it that there will not, in fact, be any new elections at all, but that the duke shall select the new legislature personally. For he, with the military and the civil service behind him, is no longer a mere duke, or even a viceroy. He is a president – the undisputed President of Quito.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL12.A;¡Viva el Presidente!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL13.T;A Truly Romantic Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL13.D;Muyuroney allied with the other Romantico factions  wasted no time in smashing the Realistas once they had enough military and civilian personnel in his confidence. The Duke of Tupac was ousted by a contingent of soldiers, and met his end in the Quito barracks.To replace Tupac, the Assembly has voted for the old Sadino to become the head of the state as the first president of the revolutionary Quitenese Assembly, hoping he can act as a moderating force between Don Wilka moderates and Muyuroney and the radicals. With the Romanticos in charge, pamphlets and broadsheets are being printed and distributed across Quito to bring the news of the revolution to the people. Across Quito, true local democracy is being established, all according to enlightened Romantico guidelines. And now that the revolution has been secured in Quito…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL13.A;It soon will enlighten the world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL14.T;The Power Struggle;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL14.D;It took less than two months for the Coalition members to accuse each other of betraying the Revolution and sabotaging the Constitutional process. To aggravate the matters, Presidente Sadino was shot by a former retainer of Tupac in broad daylight as he went to the Assembly to present a new plan of action for the Revolution. As the Constitution is not yet written, the radicals in the Assembly have demanded the establishment of a collective Autonomist Revolutionary Committee which should handle affairs of state with members elected by the Assembly every two months, while Don Willka has demanded that he should succeed Sadino as President of the Assembly and prevent the rise of anarchy with a shared executive. It now falls to the indecisive and nonpartisan deputies of the Assembly to decide. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL14.A;Wilka should become President;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL14.B;The Comité carries the day;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL15.T;A Meeting with the Romanticos;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL15.D;The Duke of Tupac is no friend to the Romanticos, but the continued burden of Spanish rule has caused him to agree with them on one point : Quito cannot remain a mere colony of a faraway European power. Thus, he has reached out to the Romanticos through his own intermediaries to arrange a meeting with them. It took several weeks of touch-and-go exchanges, but Tupac was finally able to secure the audience of some of the highest-ranking Romanticos under conditions of strict secrecy. From the start, the meeting was tense, and it only got worse when the Romanticos laid out a series of demands upon which their assistance would be contingent. Enfranchisement of the natives, nationalization of the largest church estates, and a democratically elected military high command were some of their most notable points. The meeting concluded with…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

# CAL16.D;"Kings, aristocrats, tyrants, whoever they are, are slaves in revolt against the sovereign of the earth, which is the human race, and against the legislator of the universe, which is nature." – Manuel Sandino\n\nWith Cusco in our hands, Muyuroney has determined that the time has come to sever its bonds with Tawantinsuyu and cement its loyalty. For centuries, the brutal and tyrannical system of Inca rule has degraded the people and trampled upon their rights. That ends today! Our righteous citizen-soldiers are sweeping across the city, hunting down anyone who has oppressed the people. We may be the enlightened synthesis of Andean and European ways, but the cancerous and gangrenous limbs of Andean society must be pruned if we are to prosper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL16.A;And prune we shall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL17.T;The Doom that Came to Cusco;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL17.D;'Evil is the disease and violence is the medicine. We must cut at the roots. The people must know their rights and demand them, they must be armed, they must take hold of all the little tyrants of the whole realm. They must overturn the monstrosity of their former oppressive government and erect a new and equal one in its stead. People that believe that the rest of humanity is made to serve at their pleasure will disapprove, but it is not them that we must listen to. It is about avenging the injustice inflicted upon a whole people by its oppressors.' -  Clodio ‘El Puma' Muyuroney\nWith Cusco in our hands, the time has come to illuminate it with our revolutionary light. For centuries, the brutal and tyrannical system of the Empire has degraded the people and trampled upon their rights. That ends today! A new special military administration is ruling the former heartlands of the Empire and the Damoclinas are already a common sight on the city streets. Never again will the despotic cruelties of the Inca threaten our righteous citizens!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL17.A;Revolutionary justice is justice perfected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL18.T;La Pragmatiana;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL18.D;The “Pragmatiana” is a term used by modern historians to describe the period of Quitenese history in which the post-Realistas, most famously the Pragmatistas, came to power. While firmly aligned with the broad Romantic platform, the Pragmatistas emphasized a more reserved approach to government policy, as opposed to the Utopianism of early Romanticos. They are most well-known for advocating “decentralization of both state and citizen,” as described in the Pragmatista party charter of $YEAR$. They condemned the “Quitenese Dream” as “hypocritical, oppressive, and irreconcilably opposed to reality.” Instead, they advocated for a decentralized federation of "nations within a state," defining nations as corporate groups with limited self-organization. Each citizen, they argued, would naturally and willingly align with whichever group best represented them. The Pragmatistas were also pro-immigrant, yet prioritized domestic over foreign policy and have been described (not without controversy) as isolationists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL18.A;The flames of the Revolution are growing colder – thankfully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL19.T;The Land Reform Act;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL19.D;For centuries – millenia, even! – the peoples of our land have toiled for the sake of heartless masters who put forth not an ounce of effort to reap their wealth. The infection of serfdom and feudalism ran rife through both the Spanish and the Inca Empires. Generations have lived and died on land which they labored upon, but did not own, and received a pittance for their actions. No more! The new Land Reform Act has leveled the rural playing field. All tenant estates, regardless of the race of the landlord, have been broken up and handed back to their true owners, the people who farm them. As the so-called “nobles” did not deserve this land in the first place, they will not be compensated for it. Instead, we shall aid the peasants in setting up their farms and securing initial credit. The aristocracy is furious, but the people rejoice at their freedom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

# CAL20.T;The Growth of Uraycusta;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL20.D;While our nation has many important ports, none are as fast-growing as Uraycusta. The city is a world-renowned port, serving as a critical juncture for ships travelling between the Atlantic and the Pacific. Wine, fruit, and copper produced across the nation often wind up being exported out of Uraycusta. The city also plays host to several foreign expatriate communities, notably Qingqiuese, Japanese, and Burgundian. Nowhere else in $COUNTRY$ can one so easily find foreign-language newspapers. While reactionaries are unnerved by the growth of the immigrant population in Uraycusta, so far, they do not seem to be moving beyond their neighborhoods within the city. For many they are simply cogs in the great economic machine of Uraycusta, and a welcome sight for the various sailors which regularly visit the port.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL20.A;Hail the Jewel of the Pacific!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL21.T;The Quitenese Dollar;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL21.D;The world-renowned silver reserves of $COUNTRY$, specifically its Potosi mine, have long furnished silversmiths with excellent materials. The Inca had experimented with different shapes and increments of metal money but has usually preferred more informal means of exchange. Now, however, our joining of the Potosi mine with the global market has rapidly turned the Quitenese silver dollar into an international standard. Renowned for the purity of its metal content and the stability of its value, many countries which do not possess a dedicated currency of their own are starting to adopt the Quitenese dollar instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL21.A;Capital!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL22.T;The Imperial Liwru;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL22.D;“Liwru” is an artificial word – it comes from the Burgundian “Livre” Esterlin, their national currency. It eventually became a synonym of foreign-style metal coinage because of the predominance of Burgundian trade amongst foreign merchants. The world-renowned silver reserves of $COUNTRY$, specifically its Potosi mine, have long furnished silversmiths with excellent materials. The previous dynasty had experimented with different shapes and increments of metal money but has usually preferred more informal means of exchange. Now, however, our recent adoption of a new coinage, the imperial liwru, has led to it becoming an international standard. Renowned for the purity of its metal content and the stability of its value, many countries which do not possess a dedicated currency of their own are starting to adopt the liwru instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

# CAL23.T;The Imperial Qillqu;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL23.D;The world-renowned silver reserves of $COUNTRY$, specifically its Potosi mine, have long furnished silversmiths with excellent materials. Previous Sapa Incas had experimented with different shapes and increments of metal money, but our subjects have usually preferred more informal means of exchange. Now, however, our recent adoption of a new coinage, the imperial qillqu, has led to it becoming an international standard. Renowned for the purity of its metal content and the stability of its value, many countries which do not possess a dedicated currency of their own are starting to adopt the qillqu instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL23.A;Yet another example of order brought to this chaotic world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL24A.T;The National Archive Office;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL24A.D;Founded in $YEAR$, the $THISCOUNTRY_ADJ$ National Archive Office was principally created to handle the vast among of quipus across the nation and bring them into a more readable format. These lengths of knotted cord have been used for centuries by the people of the Andes to record all sorts of information, from census and tax data to complex histories and religious narratives. Expert quipu weavers could read them blindfolded. Now we have begun converting these documents – for that is what they are – into books and manuscripts, for ease of storage and reference. The work of the NAO will take years, but this undertaking will ensure that we will preserve whatever information is possible to save.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL24A.A;We’d best get to work…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL25.T;The Coronation of Pachacuti II;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL25.D;The inauguration of our new Sapa Inca was attended by all the eminent nobles of the realm, as well as foreign observers. As Pachacuti II is a Catholic, certain elements of traditional Inca coronations – such as the ritual sacrifice of animals and idols – were omitted, but the ceremony was still Inca in nature. The participants gathered in the Awkaypata, the central plaza, along with Inca-style statues of certain Catholic saints. Gifts of elegant garments and jewelry were assembled, since this ceremony was also the wedding of Pachacuti II to Anawarki, the sister of the previous Sapa Inca. The Archbishop of Quito led a prayer soliciting God and the intercession of the saints in granting the emperor health and a long life, victory in battle, many children to succeed him, and peace in his time. Once this was done, the Archbishop solemnly crowned Pachacuti II Emperor of the Inca, to the cheering adulation of the crowd.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL25.A;And thus dawns the Tupac era.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL26.T;The Birth of Maria;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL26.D;The Emperor’s personal life has grown brighter with the birth of his newest child, a daughter named Maria. His first son was stillborn, while his second took ill and died before his first birthday. He was despairing of being able to have a child, for his marriage to Anawarki was far from being happy – he married her to cement his claim to the throne, not out of any special attraction. But so far Maria seems to be a healthy and cheerful baby. The news has helped to distract from the close role which the emperor is playing in domestic politics, intervening in smaller scale matters one would normally think beneath the head of state. Though some more reactionary ministers murmur that they hope that Pachacuti II and his wife will have a son in the future, for now the realm is simply enjoying the birth of the newest member of the House of Tupac-Cuzi.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL26.A;She has his eyes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL27.T;Princess Maria Made Heiress;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL27.D;As we have inherited a considerable amount of Spanish law, this includes the quasi-Salic provisions against female rulers. Moreover, Andean traditions abhor the notion of a female sovereign. Thus, the news that the emperor had officially designated Princess Maria as his heiress frustrated reactionaries of both backgrounds. Pachacuti II’s lack of a son made it all but inevitable, but the news has been received badly by traditionalists all the same. In response to the announcement several reactionary newspapers issued editorials strongly questioning Maria’s competence or qualification to rule. The emperor responded by arresting the authors of said articles, and in one case shutting a whole paper down and confiscating its office. His restrictions on freedom of expression come as further pressure is mounting for reforms, calls which the Emperor has so far resisted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL27.A;Why can’t they write about something nice, like how good my daughter is?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL28.T;An Unexpected Retirement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL28.D;Emperor Pachacuti II had always intended to rule until he was incapable of governing, or until the Heavens took him, whichever came first. Some people, however, were not willing to wait that long for the expansion of democracy. A liberal conspiracy between reformist politicians and sympathetic army officers has rallied to force the emperor to abdicate – and it is led by none other than Crown Princess Maria. The new Empress immediately issued a new royal charter of rights, devolving significant powers onto the national Cortes and expanding the voting franchise. Meanwhile, Pachacuti II has returned to his family’s original Chimu estate. Reactionaries are infuriated at a woman taking the throne, but most of our citizens are simply glad that the era of absolute rule is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL28.A;¡Viva la Emperatriz!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL29.T;Maria Proclaimed Regent;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL29.D;Last night, Emperor Pachacuti II suffered a severe stroke as he was preparing for bed. While he survived, now he is barely conscious, and not physically capable of ruling the nation. Thus, the Cortes have declared Crown Princess Maria the regent of the Inca Empire. Maria has promised to rule with wisdom and fairness, and to steward and shepherd the nation. Dark rumors are swirling among reactionaries, however, that the emperor did not suffer a stroke at all but was instead poisoned or otherwise incapacitated on Maria’s orders to take power. Maria is known to be far more democratically minded than her father and it had been hoped that her succession would bring reforms. With the Regent in such a precarious position, it seems doubtful that she could afford to radically change Inca society.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL29.A;Surely he will recover soon…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL30.T;Emperor Pachacuti II and his daughter Maria on Friday, $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL30.D;After almost a year of drifting in and out of consciousness, Emperor Pachacuti II finally recovered his full senses a few days ago. While his attendants had intended to break the news of the past few months to him slowly and gradually, the emperor is a cunning man even in his advanced age and ferreted out all the details. He soon confronted Regent Maria, accusing her of attempting to usurp the throne, and intimating that he suspected her of poisoning him (possibly having gleaned such rumors during his investigations). Maria retorted that she was only fulfilling the role that he himself had charged her with, and that she had not done anything rash. The argument devolved into heated shouting, whereupon Pachacuti II seized the halberd-like staff which is the traditional Inca symbol of imperial office and struck Maria. To his horror, she collapsed on the floor. The stress of the situation overwhelmed Pachacuti : as the royal attendants raced into the room, they found him in the throes of a heart attack…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL30.A;¡Dios nos ayuda a todos!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL31.T;False Dawn;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL31.D;Maria’s head wound proved fatal, and Pachacuti II died from a heart attack not long afterward. Palace officials quickly realized that allowing such news to leak out into the public could ignite chaos, inspire various Tupac-Cuzi members to feud for the throne, or even plunge the nation into another civil war like the disastrous struggle of the 17th century. Thus, the imperial clergy, recalling the ancient Inca traditions of venerating departed Sapa Incas, have declared that the emperor has “entered occlusion.” All mention of Maria’s rule as regent is being erased from official records, and a wawqi (detailed golden idol) of the emperor has been placed in the throne room. The empire shall continue to be “ruled” by Pachacuti II, with the Imperial College (a council of Catholic and indigenous pagan priests) led by the Willaq Umu interpreting his will. This new regency has caused widespread agitation in the Empire as Catholics refuse this idolatry and liberals the return of Inca absolutism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL31.A;Long live the Emperor...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL32.T;The Death of Pachacuti II;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL32.D;The emperor survived his heart attack, but he could not bear to live with himself, knowing what he had done. He went to the palace’s kitchen and locked himself inside, and, after attendants heard a loud thumping sound and forced open the door, was found dead. Perhaps inspired by his own accusations towards his daughter, he chose to poison himself using the Japanese fish which were to feature in tonight’s dinner. Tragically, Maria had not died, but was merely comatose, and awoke an hour after his death. Anguished by the revelation of her father’s suicide, she was inconsolable for days afterward. While all the empire grieves Pachacuti II, the government must continue. She has fulfilled her duty as Crown Princess and has been proclaimed Empress Maria, and her first act as sovereign has been to issue a new royal charter which empowers the Cortes Nacional and expands the voting franchise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL32.A;In the depths of suffering, the world has the audacity to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL33.T;The Death of Pachacuti II;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL33.D;While Pachacuti II’s memory never failed him, by 1880 his body was rapidly declining. He lost all vision in his left eye, could not walk without a cane (and gave up trying to use stairs after 1879), and rarely ventured beyond his manor or its immediate grounds. Yet even in this state, he refused to be idle. Shortly after his retirement, he had taken up painting, importing books on the art from Burgundy, Venice, Japan, and Qingqiu. The works that he produced in the final years of his life were described as “a sublime combination of European, Asian, and indigenous styles…though unrefined, possessing a sense of restrained and submerged beauty, of incipient wonder concealed in a manner which only heightens its allure.” It was at his canvas that the emperor was found dead this morning, having moved to the balcony to get a better view of the sunrise. The unfinished work, an impressionist rendering of Cusco as it was in the first Pachacuti’s time, would become a national symbol of a longing for the Inca Empire’s future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL33.A;From the Sun, he descended : to the Sun, he returned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL36.T;The Imperial Banner Raised over Tierra del Fuego;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL36.D;The southernmost extreme of Ameriga was dubbed “Tierra del Fuego” or “Land of Fire” by Spanish explorers, who saw the bonfires lit by native tribes of the region while sailing past. Though the weather and the seas of this region are infamously dangerous, countless vessels brave it each year to round the continent. Now, the imperial banner has for the first time been raised over the region, consolidating our administration in Tierra del Fuego. The acquisition of such a far-flung place, and the geographical security which its possession grants our empire, has increased the emperor’s popularity in the eyes of the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL36.A;May it never be lowered!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL37.T;The Imperial Banner Raised over the Pampas;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL37.D;The pampas, from the Quechua “plains,” have sustained nomadic peoples like the Het for thousands of years. Some of the best pastoral lands in the world, the pampas are also useful for farming. For many years, European colonizers have warred with the indigenous peoples, be they Beornians or other interlopers. Now, the imperial banner has for the first time been raised over the region, cementing the consolidation of our administration of the Pampas. The acquisition of such a fertile place, and the protection from the eastern Amerigans which its possession grants our empire, has shorn up the emperor’s popularity in the eyes of the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL37.A;May it never be lowered!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL38.T;The Imperial Banner Raised over Cartegena de Indias;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL38.D;Many peoples have made their home in the Cartegena region – the Mocana of the Caribs were the most numerous when the Spanish arrived. Their violent subjugation of the region led them to christen it “Cartegena de Indias” after a notable Iberian city. It soon became one of the primary colonial nerve centers, processing vast amounts of trade, and gaining an international reputation as a major Amerigan and Caribbean port. Now, the imperial banner has for the first time been raised over the region, cementing the consolidation of our administration in Cartegena de Indias. The acquisition of such an important and famous place, and the naval power projection which its possession grants our empire, has shorn up the emperor’s popularity in the eyes of the people. The emperor has long styled himself the “Liberator of the Andes” and now it is a fact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL38.A;May it never be lowered!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL39.T;The Imperial Banner Raised over the Amazon;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL39.D;The mighty Amazon River and its vast basin are home to a fantastic variety of life, plant and animal. The region’s ecological beauty and diversity is overwhelming – and so is its economic potential if the tremendous obstacles of geography could be overcome. Spain made some attempts to settle the northeastern basin, but it was the Dual Monarchy which claimed its coastal edge and thus the interior, a claim inherited by Amazonie. Now, the imperial banner has for the first time been raised over the region, cementing the consolidation of our administration in the Amazon River basin. The acquisition of such a massive and wondrous place, and the international prestige which its possession grants our empire, has shorn up the emperor’s popularity in the eyes of the people. The emperor has long styled himself the “Guardian of the Amazon” and now it is a fact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL39.A;May it never be lowered!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL40.T;The Imperial Banner Raised over Ava;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL40.D;Ava, the land of the Guarani, is a bastion of indigenous culture in the heart of Ameriga. Possessing considerable agricultural wealth, as well as a particularly cohesive native identity (forged in the fires of adversity from Burgundian and later Lotharian colonization), Ava’s economic possibilities have laid untapped for ages. Now, the imperial banner has for the first time been raised over the region, cementing the consolidation of our administration in Tierra del Fuego. The acquisition of such a unique place, and the strengthened defense against the eastern and southern Amerigans which its possession grants our empire, has shorn up the emperor’s popularity in the eyes of the people. The emperor has long styled himself the “Protector of the Guaranis” and now it is a fact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL40.A;May it never be lowered!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL41.T;Imperial Majesty;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL41.D;Who can resist Pachacuti II? From the depths of strife, he has raised up the Inca Empire to heights of power and fame never seen! Even the European colonizers have been forced to admit the overwhelming strength of the Inca Empire. Across the globe, our citizens are treated with respect. The word of our merchants is implicitly trusted : the allure of our culture entrances admirers from here to Anvers : and several smaller states have looked to our military while reforming their own forces. We have brought unto Ameriga the light of order, of enlightenment, of civilization, and we have done so without shoving European colonization down the natives’ throats. All of this is thanks to Emperor Pachacuti II! It is his glorious light which the grandeur of our realm magnifies and reflects all around us. The previous dynasty made pretensions of ruling the “known world,” but only we can truly be said to have brought the glory of the Inca across the globe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL41.A;A radiant sovereign is he!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL42.T;The Pachacuti Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL42.D;Our influence has permeated the whole Amerigan continent. Now Emperor Pachacuti II has decided to officially announce our role as Ameriga’s shepherd. In a royal proclamation, he outlined what he referred to as our “Continental Obligation as Master of Ameriga” but which foreign observers have dubbed the “Pachacuti Doctrine.” The emperor stated that any incursions by foreign powers upon the Amerigan continent would be taken as a threat to the Inca Empire. The remarks brought forth a chorus of objections from European powers, and it is questionable how many of them will take this proclamation seriously. The true value of it is its expression of our overwhelming influence upon the continent, and the unity of its peoples beneath our imperial banner, directly or otherwise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL42.A;We are the Protector of Ameriga!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL43.T;The Inca Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL43.D;Pachacuti was no stranger to European Liberal thought, and one of the changes he made to the Empire was the election of local officials by the population. He has now decided to grant a constitution to the Inca Empire which has resulted in several traditional elements of our political system shifting to accommodate new ideas. The Cortes Imperiales has been formed to legislate policy – though with plenty of input from the emperor, of course. A separate judiciary has also been established, though again the imperial court holds significant influence within it. While democracy is slowly being embraced by the people, many aspects of our society remain apart from foreign liberal ideals. Still, the inevitable weakening of royal authority inherent in the expansion of democracy has necessarily reduced the hold the emperor over his country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL43.A;He is still great regardless! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL44.T;The Inca Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL44.D;Pachacuti was no stranger to European Liberal thought, and one of the changes he made to the Empire was the election of local officials by the population. He had decided to grant a royal charter to the Inca Empire but his proposed document was heavily modified at the insistence of many notable politicians. The resulting constitution  of the Inca Empire has created a great transformation of our political system. The Cortes Imperiales acts almost wholly separate from the emperor’s will, while the judiciary stands upon its own footing as well. Democracy and related ideas of popular power have swept across the nation, and much of our society is realigning towards it. This has substantially reduced royal authority and grandeur in a culture where the sovereign has for ages reigned in an absolute manner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL44.A;Yet his brilliance still cannot be denied.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL45.T;The End of the Inca Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL45.D;For roughly four hundred years, the Andes were dominated by the Inca Empire. The region and the polity had for so long cohabited the same space that, in the minds of their subjects, they had become almost synonymous. But, as despot after despot came and went, the free spirit of the people persevered, never losing hope that one day they would be delivered from their servitude. That day has now come! Tupac’s dream of claiming the Inca throne and becoming another link in the chain of tyranny binding the people has been shattered. Rather than his absurd and hypocritical cherry-picking of Hispanic and Andean culture, both wholly self-serving of his imperialist aims, the national culture of $COUNTRY$ is now being realigned. The Romanticos are now hailed as our political ancestors, and their ideas used as the foundation for new political groups and aspirations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL45.A;Freedom delayed and denied no longer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL46.T;The Beornian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL46.D;For too long, we have suffered the abuses of the insolent Beornians. Their raids have terrorized our southern frontier, and they have long sought to conquer vast swaths of said lands. If we are to ever be fully secure as a nation, then we must take severe measures to prevent the Beornians from ever threatening us again. The time has come to extend the hand of our protection over the indigenous peoples of southern Ameriga and drive the Beornians back eastwards. They will be allowed to possess the land necessary to survive, but never again will they raise their hands against our subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL46.A;Camelot shall fall!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL47.T;The Inkans Attack!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL47.D;When we heard that the Inkan Empire had been conquered by the heretical Catholic Quiteneses, we were all astonished, though it made some amount of sense given the modicum of superiority the Quiteneses held over the Inkan savages. What was truly shocking was when the mad ruler of Quito claimed the Inkan throne for himself and founded a new imperial dynasty! We always knew that Catholics were foul crypto-pagan heretics but few of us ever dreamed that fellow Christians would be capable of such insanity. Now, the northern abomination that is the new Inkan Empire has launched a war of aggression against us! Their treacherous diplomats babble all sorts of justifications for this, but we know that they are simply violent brutes. As our priests marshal the faithful for holy war, the sons of England prepare to crush these monstrous heathens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL47.A;For king and country!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL48.T;The Treaty of Camelot;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL48.D;To the astonishment and horror of all our subjects, the Beornians have bested the imperial armies. A series of losses along the frontier allowed the Beornians to invade the interior to the point where the emperor was forced to sue for peace rather than allow further devastation of the countryside. The Beornians demanded that he travel in person to their capital city of Camelot. There, in a shameful ceremony, he was forced to publicly acknowledge their monarch as the rightful king of Beornia, England, and “New Mercia,” their appellation for the frontier regions which they have now annexed. Even worse, it seems that the unruly Mapuche have taken the opportunity to launch yet another revolt and given the state of the imperial armies it seems that they will succeed for the time being. Pachacuti II and the whole Inca Empire have been humiliated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL48.A;The Sapa Inca turns to the sky for answers but receives only rain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL49.T;Colonization of the Andes;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL49.D;The conquest of New Mercia was followed by an intense propaganda by the Beornian state to show the rest of the civilized world that their conquest was just because of the Inca aggression. New Mercia proper and especially the port of Edward's Landing were targeted for propaganda actions which showed the progress of civilization thanks to Beornian settlers. However, the seizure of local lands by the settlers and the Beornian administration were of course never mentioned. In the mountains, far from international observations, the Beornian army was free to destroy villages and accorporate land for future colonization with countless villages burnt. When the Beornians did not act directly, entire villages were left to starve, resulting in one of the most brutal massacres of the XIXth century.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL49.A;Beornia acted in self-defense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL50.T;White Peace in the Andes;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL50.D;Despite the best efforts of the Inka hordes, our mighty armies cloaked in the grace of God have fended off their assault upon our innocent kingdom. In the resulting peace treaty, the Inkans have been suitably humiliated. They have been forced to recognize our righteous sovereign as the rightful King of Beornia, forsaking their claims to any lands which we currently control. While some had hoped for a more decisive victory, many simply rejoice in the defeat of the heathen foe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL50.A;God be praised!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL500.T;The Year of Shame;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL500.D;Not since 1066, on that evil day when the Norman usurpers forced the yoke of slavery upon the Anglo-Saxon neck, have the faithful sons of England known such dark times as this. The savage Inkan despot has driven the whole Beornian Army from the field and arrived under arms at the gates of Camelot. He then demanded that King Edward surrender all lands beyond Avalon, or he would destroy Camelot. Facing annihilation, Edward had no choice but to accept.\n\nThe Bible tells us that the rainbow was a promise from God – a sign of His covenant with humanity that He would never send a deluge to destroy the world again. That symbol, which has given hope and joy to Christians of all ages for centuries, is no longer beloved. As the rainbow standard rises across the former lands of Beornia, it has become a blasphemous reminder of their victory over us. $YEAR$ will always be remembered as the epoch of our greatest failure, the Year of Shame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL500.A;My God, my God, why has Thou forsaken me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL51.T;Beornia Neutered;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL51.D;As we had expected, the Beornians proved little challenge for the imperial armies. A series of victories across the southern mountains and plains allowed the soldiers of the Inca Empire to surround the capital of Camelot. Threatening to destroy the city, our Sapa Inca forced their pitiful “king” to surrender all desired lands to our enlightened rule. Even now, the imperial bureaucracy is dividing the new lands for mitma resettlement. The current occupiers will likely pose a problem, inclined as they are to cling to their backwards nation and their bizarre Protestant Christian sect, but as time goes on they will learn their place within the empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL51.A;And if they don’t, we have ways of discipling them..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL52.T;Religion in the Inca Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL52.D;When Emperor Pachacuti II established our new imperial dynasty, many of both Catholic and traditional indigenous faiths were concerned about the religious future of our realm. Pachacuti II, however, knew that attempting to either stamp out the existing worship of gods like Inti, or discard the Catholic faith in favor of said gods, would be equally ruinous paths. Yet at the same time the emperor himself is still a Catholic and he does not pretend otherwise. Therefore, he has instituted liberty of personal conscience for religion, but allocating support towards the Catholic Church and depicting Catholic saints in the manner of certain local gods to encourage conversion. While Catholicism is not being imposed there is a general sense amongst our citizens that being a Catholic (or at least acting like one) is the best way to socially advance. Native believers are of course embittered by this but most are focused on preserving traditional ways rather than attempting to destroy the state’s aid of Catholicism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL52.A;In the beginning was the Word…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL53.T;The Civil Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL53.D;For ages, the fetters of organized religion have kept our citizens in chains. Both the Catholic Church and the state-managed faith of the natives were used by the elite to bind the people and subordinate their interests. This is no longer the case. We have taken great pains to exclude any mention of any religion from our constitution, and instituted strict, absolute, inviolable separation of church and state. No religious organization will receive so much as a penny of government funds from here on, and all churches must pay taxes. Ceremonies such as marriages, which used to require a priest, can now be accomplished through a simple civil procedure. While traditionalists of all religions are severely displeased by our actions, we are hopeful that future generations shall inherit a nation free of sectarianism or the sinister manipulations of the clergy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL53.A;Emancipation of the mind at last!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL13.T;A Truly Romantic Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL13.D;Muyuroney allied with the other Romantico factions  wasted no time in smashing the Realistas once they had enough military and civilian personnel in his confidence. The Duke of Tupac was ousted by a contingent of soldiers, and met his end in the Quito barracks.To replace Tupac, the Assembly has voted for the old Sadino to become the head of the state as the first president of the revolutionary Quitenese Assembly, hoping he can act as a moderating force between Don Wilka moderates and Muyuroney and the radicals. With the Romanticos in charge, pamphlets and broadsheets are being printed and distributed across Quito to bring the news of the revolution to the people. Across Quito, true local democracy is being established, all according to enlightened Romantico guidelines. And now that the revolution has been secured in Quito…;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL13.A;It soon will enlighten the world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL14.T;The Power Struggle;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL14.D;It took less than two months for the Coalition members to accuse each other of betraying the Revolution and sabotaging the Constitutional process. To aggravate the matters, Presidente Sadino was shot by a former retainer of Tupac in broad daylight as he went to the Assembly to present a new plan of action for the Revolution. As the Constitution is not yet written, the radicals in the Assembly have demanded the establishment of a collective Autonomist Revolutionary Committee which should handle affairs of state with members elected by the Assembly every two months, while Don Willka has demanded that he should succeed Sadino as President of the Assembly and prevent the rise of anarchy with a shared executive.

# CAL17.D;"Evil is the disease and violence is the medicine. We must cut at the roots. The people must know their rights and demand them, they must be armed, they must take hold of all the little tyrants of the whole realm. They must overturn the monstrosity of their former oppressive government and erect a new and equal one in its stead. People that believe that the rest of humanity is made to serve at their pleasure will disapprove, but it is not them that we must listen to. It is about avenging the injustice inflicted upon a whole people by its oppressors." -  Clodio ‘El Puma” Muyuroney\nWith Cusco in our hands, the time has come to illuminate it with our revolutionary light. For centuries, the brutal and tyrannical system of the Empire has degraded the people and trampled upon their rights. That ends today! A new special military administration is ruling the former heartlands of the Empire and the Damoclinas are already a common sight on the city streets. Never again will the despotic cruelties of the Inca threaten our righteous citizens!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

# CAL200.A;’the Revolution is over! You yourselves have destroyed it by violating all your principles. It no longer has the respect of anyone’ - Don Wilka’s answer to a Radical Romantico deputy \n\n The vote was short but nonetheless a victory for Willka. Denouncing the corruption of the Assembly, the Radicals tried to get the army and the people to rise but they were soon crushed by Wilka forces, likely paid with his own money or funds given by the Chimu families he is close to.. The coup attempt allowed Wilka to purge his opponents while posting his own men at key posts in the Republic. Popular suffrage even for local elections has been suspended, with a new Assembly elected by the wealthy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
# CAL201.T;The Abolishment of Serfdom;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
# CAL201.D;One of Dom Willka’s main campaign promises was the immediate abolition of serfdom, a corrupting practice which had taken hold of the Andes in the last decades and one that every powerholder in the area partook in, exploiting the peoples of the Andes for a quick profit - Dom Willka isn’t one to go against profit and prosperity, such an institution must not be allowed to exist in a modern republic prepared for the times ahead. While the nobles and aristocrats behind serfdom rallied behind Willka during the tumultuous times before his ascension as president of our nation aren’t taking to this lightly, Willka assures them that while their power and wealth isn’t up for negotiation, so isn’t the freedom and liberty of the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

# CAL202.T;The $YEAR$ Act against treason;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
# CAL202.D;In order to satiate the nobility of Chimu and the myriad caciques in the Andes, Dom Willka and his assembly have made their goals clear at attaining stability in the andes. The former Inca alongside their associated royals will be put to trial and their wealth confiscate and the former Spanish hacendados plaguing Quito and Guayaquil summarily executed do treason against the Andes and its people ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL202.A;Justice for the people!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
# CAL203.T;Empresas Mixtas de Cajamarca;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
# CAL203.D;When Dom Willka abolished serfdom and proceeded to free those under its yoke, all of his aides and government associates knew he had a plan to satiate the former magnates of serfdom and caste aristocrats who backed his movement to begin with. Thus, Wilka and his allies have ideated a marvellous and boundary-pushing scheme at bringing wealth to the Andes and making sure his allies remains allies: A series of government-magnate led enterprises and companies will be created and distributed between the former nobles of the realm and Willka’s closest allies, aimed at exploiting the lands in an official manner, under the distant gaze of the state. The first of these companies, inaugurated in the region most affected by the abolishment of Serfdom, Cajamarca, begins it activities today: The Empresas Mixtas de Cajamarca will be tasked with the uncovering of mineral deposits and the diversification of agricultural activities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

# CAL204.T;Asociación Agro-Minera del Norte Andino;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
# CAL204.D;The mountains and jungle valleys of the North Andean Spine have never truly been used for any economic activity other than harsh monocropping of coffee and sugar, with any other possibilities never being explored or attempted. Our experienced industrialists and oligarchs, however, after consulting with small-scale miners and adventurous farmers, have been led to the discovery of bountiful mountains of coal. Along with this, the southern half of Herreria was also found to be suitable for diversification in cultivation, with spices such as pepper taking hold and rapidly expanding through the smaller sharecroppers of the Cauca Valley. Thus, the newly-born Asociación Agro-Minera del Norte Andino has been granted paramount rights to any coal deposits and has also been granted large tracts of lands in the southern valleys, with the paramount objective of bringing wealth and prosperity to the Northern Andes, as well as moving its economy away from the terrible colonial structure imposed unto us by our former masters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

# CAL205.T;Consejo Económico del Sur Andino;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
# CAL205.D;The valleys, forests and mountains of Chili were long known to the Incans and Aimara before them as bountiful lands, with traditional economies using the vast valleys for cattling, seasonal farming as well as the mining of both silver and copper since time immemorial. While the Incan Empire never truly made Chili a cornerstone of their economy, instead being relegated as a frontier, our wise industrialists see the potential in this land from every single angle. Thus, we shall appoint a body concerning the economic development and exploitation of Chili’s resources, hoping to truly transform the valleys from a backwater to a true economic powerhouse within Andesia - From mining, to fishing, to agriculture, the Consejo Económico del Sur Andino will make sure to oversee the economic ascension of Chiri within Andesia, spurring colonial efforts and sponsoring the foundation of a number of cities, which they assure will bring our state profits unending..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL205.A;A new industrial heartland?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
# CAL206.T;Unión Agrícola de los Llanos;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
# CAL206.D;The vast plains of the West-Aurelianan llanos, owing to their far-flungness and lawlessness, have never been truly settled or exploited economically, being misused for small-scale cattling and fishing along the banks of its rivers. However, our great industrialists see great potential in this land as a possible breadbasket, which has led to the formation of a plan to turn the llanos into the agricultural heartland of Andesia, providing grain and jobs to the peoples while turning this backwater into a truly important part of our state. The formation of the new Unión Agroindustrial de los Llanos will oversee development in the area, starting with the foundation of a string of new settlements with the goal of funnelling migrants to the vast llanos and bring prosperity to them, of course, and a good margin of profits!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

# CAL210.D;The Comité sidelined Wilka’s bid for power only for him to try to take power by force. His mercenaries were however no match against the power of the people who rallied to defend their deputies. In cities and towns across Quito, orders have gone out to destroy the enemies of liberty : the Damoclinas are being raised up throughout the nation, where anyone known to have worked for the Duke, the Spanish or the ‘aristocratic’ faction of Wilka. shall meet their fitting end - Willka  was their first victim. Meanwhile in the capital, a frightened Assembly has confirmed the powers of the Comité and their spokesperson, Muyuroney. While a Constitution is being drafted, the country shall be ruled by the elected members of the Comité who already have published decrees for the coming war with the barbarous Empire of the Inca, notably that all adult males shall be enrolled into the military, as must any man who wishes to obtain Quitenese citizenship from now on. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

# CAL211.T;The Rule of Terror;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
# CAL211.D;As promised by the Comité, Andesian society is being reorganised in accordance with true Romantic principles, the enlightened synthesis of Andean and European culture. Many thought that the Rule of Terror launched by the Comité after Willka’s coup would end with the execution of the last Inca emperor and the new peace, but the Comité has now turned his attention towards the enemies of the interior. Popular committees, so far restricted to urban centres and a few outposts in the countryside, target the priests, aristocrats be they newly conquered caciques or Quitenese citizens. While weariness is a common feeling for many of the Andesian people, especially in the new ‘Republican territories’ of the dead Empire, few can express it and Revolutionaries just seem bound to radicalize more and more … but up to what point ?,;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL211.A;It is satisfying to be able to announce to a free people that the fatherland is going be saved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
# CAL212.T;The Revolutionary tide;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
# CAL212.D;As the ‘Mallku’ of the Qullaw is under the protection of the Burgundians who approached him to secure their sulphur and silver trade in Baie d’Argent, we can hardly provoke the Burgundians into a full fledged war. Thankfully for us, the Lupaca leader Tupac Katari has approached us with a plan : a large shipment of weapons from Burgundy is planned to arrive in Arica by next month. His followers will take control of the port and use the weapons to take power on the Altiplano. While this will allow us to prevent a direct war with Anvers, there might be consequences still, especially as a few Burgundian traders live in the port. We have urged Katari to pay attention and prevent any harm to the Europeans but his newly Republican zeal matches the zeal of Clodio Muyuroney. .;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

# CAL213.T;Blood on the Qullaw;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
# CAL213.D;Armed and smuggled by Andesian agents, Tupac Katari leader of the Lupaca has seized Baie d’Argent and then used the Burgundian weapons he seized to march on Shinkillaqta to seize power. The Monarchy has been abolished and Tupac Katari proclaimed himself Protector of the new Qullaw Republic. Life for the average Qullaw citizen does not change much : Katari has put his own kin at the highest positions in his new ‘Republic’ and all the important offices of state are in the hands of his clan or allied clans..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL213.A;A good development for the Qullaw;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
# CAL214.T;The Baie d’Argent incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
# CAL214.D;More news from the Andes as Burgundian merchants have been attacked in our former port of Baie d’Argent by Qullaw rebels funded by the Republic of Andesia. Tupac Katiri, a marginalized tribal leader of the Altiplano took Baie d’Argent by surprise and the weapons we had sold to the King of the Qullaw by the same occasion. Burgundian stores and warehouses have been looted and a few merchants have died in the troubles. Then Katiri and his followers surged to the capital and took power while establishing a Republic recognized by Andesia the following day. Again we are forced to deal with the fall of the Inca Empire and many in our government are asking that we simply let go of the region while demanding a compensation from the real people behind this outrageous attack : Andesia. But for the others, an attack on Burgundian subjects demand a strong response against the godless Republicans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

# CAL215.T;Burgundian threats;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
# CAL215.D;Katiri may have gone too far in his actions. After he left Arica, we stumbled on Burgundian traders who had died in the troubles and it is no surprise the Burgundian government is demanding compensation for the loss of property and lives experienced in Arica. While we generally understand that Burgundy does not seek war but merely a diplomatic solution, their terms would be harsh for our Republic and also be seen as submission to imperialism by Radicals but refusing this deal could mean an embargo that would also be detrimental to our economy or §Rworse a direct military intervention!§;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL215.A;We will compensate the Burgundians;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL215.B;We do not bow to foreigners!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,  
# CAL216.T;Andesian compensation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
# CAL216.D;Our threats have worked : the Andesian government has agreed to our demands, giving financial compensation to the victims of Baie Salée while also giving privileged status to our merchants. Many in our government feel that we have gained a better deal since we keep our influence and even extend it. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL216.A;Burgundian might solves all problems;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
# CAL217.T;Andesia refuses;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
# CAL217.D;We were shocked to learn that the Andesians refused our offer. Newspapers in Anvers are demanding that we take action and the political opposition rejoices to see our plans fail so utterly. We are left with two options now : organize an embargo on Andesia, forbidding them to take loans from our banks, and destroying the trust others could have with them. Or we take military action as the jingoist members of the cabinet have demanded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL217.A;An embargo will destroy them more effectively than military intervention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
# CAL217.B;”Civis Burgundio sum”, we should have listened to that the first time…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
# CAL218.T;The Burgundian embargo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
# CAL218.D;The Burgundian government has severed diplomatic ties with our Republic and enacted an embargo on our country. Our financial capacities were already quite limited because of the distrust our Revolution has engendered amongst the bankers of Europe, but having the Burgundian government embargo us has made the matters worse. We might have stood up to an imperialist power but we are likely to pay the price in the coming years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

# CAL219.T;The Collao sister republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
# CAL219.D;With the matter of Burgundian demands solved, Katiri has accepted our treaty of friendship and allowed our agents and soldiers into the South Andine Republic. The rule of Katiri is tenuous, as the followers of the Mallku agitate against the new clans in power and the tight network of relationships that built the Qullaw state in the first place, lies broken. With our administrators helping solidify the Republic and our soldiers experienced in dealing with insurgents, our sister Republic shall soon be a haven of democracy and republicanism!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

# CAL220.D;The Qullaw, a natural extension of any country claiming sovereignty over the Andes, finds itself under foreign occupation.

# CAL221.D;’How could liberty ever have established itself amongst us?

Fifty years of anarchy await you unless a true statesman and patriot arise with powers akin to the dictators of Ancient Rome. O prating people, if you did but know how to act!’ - Clodio Muyuroney\n In the last few weeks, Muyuroney fell sick, forcing him to reduce his political presence to a minimum. It thus surprised the whole Assembly when he came unannounced and likely still suffering from a fever, and made a two-hour long speech in which he denounced both the moderates of the Assembly and his allies in the Comité. After being removed from the Tribune by force for his call to insurrection, uneasiness pervaded the Assembly : for many moderates, it was their time to act.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Clodio Muyuroney, the architect of ‘El Terrór’, along with his collaborators in the Comité have been subjected to a quick trial without jury, with a simple verdict being ruled out: Treason. Upon hearing this verdict, the last words uttered by Clodio rang through the building like a maddened scream: “If I am guilty of something, let it be of Romance, because I adored my motherland so.”.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Tthe remaining moderates and liberal-minded individuals in the National Assemlby must now decide the immediate political future and structure of Andesia. The first speeches have unanimously denounced Muyuroney and his minions in the Comité as the sole responsibles of the ‘Terror’ that plagued the nation, despite most deputies approving the decisions of the said comité not a month ago. In an ironic twist of fate, Gabriel Marquez de Susa, ‘the Executioner of Cuzco’, famous for his use of cannons during the mass execution of the Inca nobility, and friend of Muyuroney until recently, presides the Assembly and the debates. While the remaining liberal firebrands who distanced themselves from Muyuroney’s actions demand for the revolution to continue, albeit moderately, the more conservative-minded actors suggest reorganizing the country akin to Dom Willka’s old ideals to finally restore order and bring prosperity to the Andes. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Ravingly popular, the regime enjoys rapturous support in the lower rungs of society, while oligarchs and the nobility can only watch from the sidelines and shudder. With this, Muyuroney has dissolved the Assembly and assumed total powers from the Palacio de Gobierno, with the ‘Terrór’ coming to an end and a sense of relative normalcy permeating the streets of Andesia, El Líder shall exercise the will of the people with extreme prejudice against those threatening it, be it from within or without.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Already reports from the Centroandean district and the Qullaw tell of Federalist sympathies and failing in putting down this act of subversion and treason against our Fatherland would surely spell the end of our regime, as the importance of the Chimu coast, from symbolically to economically, is of gargantuan size. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

Unlike his character, Muyuroney’s absconding wasn’t preceded by any speech, instead being a relatively quiet affair, with the former Líder Supremo donating the last two years worth of his salary alongside returning the spoils of war of the Federalist Revolt back to their owners, a surprising act, even if ‘El Puma’ was never known to be a particularly money-inclined individual..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

# CAL241.A;Damnation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
# CAL242.T;Victory over Imperialism!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
# CAL242.D;The death of Burgundian merchants in Arica spurred the Burgundian government to intervene militarily in Andesia to avenge their countrymen. Few could imagine that their intervention would be defeated by the Republican armies with Burgundy forced to accept their loss of influence in the former Inca Empire. Celebrations have erupted throughout Andesia and the Assembly has declared that this date shall now be celebrated as a national holyday to commemorate the victory over European Imperialism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL242.A;Victoria !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
# CAL243.T;The Empire of the Inca;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
# CAL243.D;When Burgundy intervened following the Arica massacre and the coup in Qullaw against the Andesian Republic, the Anvers government had little plan besides showing reprisal for the killing of their merchants. The Republicans refused peace following the bombardment of their ports and the Burgundian army had to march on the capital and occupy the countryside. The Republican leaders have not deposed arms and chose to flee to the countryside. Some Moderates were assembled and proposed the inauguration of an European monarch to restore order to the country. Burgundy then searched for a ‘neutral candidate’ which would increase the legitimacy of the new Empire and approached the Aragonese Prince Francis-Ferdinand. The third legitimate bastard of King Joan IV, the Prince has bought off the claims of the Tupac-Cuzi family, adopted a converted son of Khispallu Inka, and has arrived in $CAPITAL$ where he has been crowned Emperor of the Andes. The Republican guerilla has seemingly increased since his arrival, and without Burgundian troops to maintain order, few observers think that this new Empire will survive;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL243.A;An Aragonese Inca ? What is this madness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
# CAL244.T;The end of the Andesian intervention ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
# CAL244.D;Andesia accepted peace after our invasion but it has not been easy to form an amicable government. Convinced that the Republican government has proved disastrous to the region, our government searched for potential emperors in Europe after assembling conservatives and moderates to form a Regency while our forces occupied the capital. A Burgundian prince was out of the question and so were Protestant Germans. In the end the Andesian delegation, which we had assembled, met with Francis-Ferdinand de Salina, an Aragonese prince, whose Catholic faith would be more amenable to the mestizo elites of the region. Now, he sits on the throne of a precarious country : guerrillas are still active and without Burgundian forces, it is doubtful he will be able to rule for long. However we now hold two protectorates in the Andes, which should supply our industry and finances with plenty of silver and minerals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL244.A;”A Burgundian shall feel confident that Burgundy will protect him against injustice and wrong, in whatever land he may be.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
# CAL245.T;An Aragonese Inca;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
# CAL245.D;Out of the three legitimized sons of Joan IV, Frances-Ferran de Salina-Lampedusa stood out as the least interested in politics and generally content with his life on his demesne. That is, until a delegation from the Andes flanked by Burgundian officials approached him to become the new leader of the Empire of the Inca. After consulting his wife and daughter, he then decided to accept the offer and sail to Ameriga. Some Aragonese hoped that this would offer new trading opportunities for our merchants, but this new Empire appears to be mostly a Burgundian puppet. Rumors of guerillas and general instability abound, and many wonder how much time Frances-Ferran will be able to rule. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL245.A;He still likes his home country!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
# CAL246.T;The Burgundian declaration of war;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
# CAL246.D;”The question, gentlemen, is to know whether the principles on which the foreign policy of Her Majesty's government has been conducted, and the sense of duty which has led us to think ourselves bound to afford protection to our fellow subjects abroad, are proper and fitting guides for those who are charged with the government of Burgundy, and whether, as the Roman, in days of old, held himself free from indignity when he could say Civis Romanus sum, so also a Burgundian subject, in whatever land he may be, shall feel confident that the watchful eye and the strong arm of Burgundy will protect him against injustice and wrong.” - Speech of the Foreign Minister of Burgundy, Charles du Thay, following the declaration of war on Andesia\n\nOur worst fears have come to pass, the Burgundians have declared war on our Republic, hoping to replace its government by their puppets. It is again a war for the survival of the Republic! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL246.A;Viva la Republica!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
# CAL247.T;Andesian Saber-Rattling;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
# CAL247.D;Fearing no repercussion or sensing weakness within us, in a grand saber-rattling and geopolitically unfounded act the Andesian government has laid claim to Herreria, our  rightful lands laying across the northern spine of the Andes. This senseless agression between sons of the same father is an affront to the survival of the Spanish men and children of Ameriga, and we shall take it upon ourselves to teach the upstarts in Andesia a lesson - If they want war, they're getting war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
# CAL247.A;We will retaliate immediatly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
# CAL247.B;We will retaliate in time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
# CAL248.T;The Granadine Wars;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
# CAL248.D;With our intent to claim Herreria reaching the government in New Granada, they have taken it upon themselves to retaliate immediatly. Such a war, costly and unpopular, will surely lay bare the faults of their corrupt and inefficient administration as well as open the path for rightful Romántico rule of the entirety of the Andes. New Granada will perish, so that liberty in the lands of New Granada can blossom once more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
# CAL248.A;We will keep them north of the Angomayo!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
# CAL249.T;Defeat in the Granadine Wars;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
# CAL249.D;Much to our dismay, the treacherous, infectiously fanaticized forces of Andesia were too much for our unprepared armies. While initially slogged in the dense, dizzying jungle valleys of Cali and Cundinamarca, the Andesian army wrought defeat after defeat upon us, which led us to the negotiation table. The consequences of our pre-emptive invasion of Andesia are our demise. The Neogranadine dream dies, and our great country is shattered into its constituents, with the lands of Herreria falling under direct jurisdiction of Andesia, as the northernmost province to be incorporated unto it, the final piece of the Andesian puzzle. While a united New-Granada may be dead for the time being, the Granadine peoples will never forgive nor forget.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
# CAL249.A;Goodbye, New Granada!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,  
# CAL250.T;The aftermath of the Granadine Wars;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL250.D;'Every man of good worth must be indifferent towards misfortune' - José de Herrera/n In a desperate bid to stall the inevitable, the republic of New Granada descended south, crossing the Angomayo and striding into Andesia hoping to shatter the dreams and aspirations of every child of the magnanimous Románticos. What they didn't expect to find, however, was an army committed towards the ideals of freedom and love- Soon, through hardship and with many lives lost, the rag-tag band of Neogranadine of soldiers of fortune was pushed to the negotiating table, leading to the demise of New Granada and the trial of its corrupt, warmongering leaders. On this day, the denizens of Herreria are freed, and José De Herrera's legacy lies redeemed, with his people finally freed from the grasp of tyrants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
# CAL250.A;A new status-quo in New Granada.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
# CAL251.T;The aftermath of the Granadine Wars;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,, 
# CAL251.D;'Men of honor have no fatherland other than that in which the citizen's rights are protected, and the sacred character of humanities' character is respected' - José de Herrera/n When the brave sons and daughters of Herrera and New Granada crossed their rubicon, the Angomayo, they knew they were marching towards their death. What they didn't expect, however, was to be welcomed as liberators. While initially slogged in the dizzying mountains and riverine jungle valleys of Quito and Jauja, the brave army of New Granada was able to repeteadly rout the fanatical, horde-like army of the Románticos, which culminated in the siege of Quito and the burning down of its presidential palace. With Muyuroney missing and rumoured dead, the Románticos' leadership has been effectively severed, and Andesia is no more, liberated from the yoke of a tyrant posing as a saviour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
