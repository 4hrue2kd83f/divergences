 dvg_caladero.1.d:0 "Between a Rock and a Hard Place"
 dvg_caladero.1.f:0 "The Viceroyalty of Cisandina has always existed apart from the rest of the Spanish New World. Seized from Tawantinsuyu ages ago, Spanish colonization has only truly been carried out in the urban areas around the north, near the cities of Quito and Guayaquil. Independence fighters from Quito, most notably the warlord Martin Ballivián (known to his adversaries as “El Podenco”), participated in a raid on the Inca capital of Cusco, sacking the city. In retaliation Washkar Inca led an army northwards, rampaging all the way to Chan Chan before Dom Henrique Tupac Cuzi de Ingapirca y Alfaoes, duke of Tupac Cuzi de Ingapirca, rallied a multi-ethnic army of indigenous warriors and Spanish-descended settlers to repel the Inca. The Duke of Tupac was made Viceroy of the colony for his efforts, but the years since then have seen Quitenese politics snarl in unfamiliar directions. Rumors of secret societies run rife around the colony, and figures around the realm may be making plans.

 dvg_caladero.2.d:0 "A Royal House in Exile"
 dvg_caladero.2.f:0 "Tawantinsuyu, the Inca Empire, had a civil war in the seventeenth century. The Inca claimant with ties to the Chimu nobility Paullu Tupac Cuzi controlled Chinchaysuyu (the northwestern half of the empire), but sought an edge over his rival, Sayri Amaru. He thus made the dangerous gamble of asking the Spanish Empire for aid, promising vague concessions if he prevailed. Sensing an opportunity, the Spanish agreed. Some say Paullu simply stalemated Amaru, others that the Spanish sabotaged him, but eventually Spain seized control of Chinchaysuyu. The first Duke of Tupac-Cuzi (often referred to simply as Tupac) was created in 1701 by King Joao III, who awarded the title to the grandson of Paullu Tupac. The Dukes took up residence in Spain and married into European Spanish nobility. The current Duke’s father was the Director of the Golden Board of Atlantia from 1810 to 1820, causing the family to return to the continent. The Duke’s tenure as Viceroy has led to most of his family joining him in their old Chimu estates."

 dvg_caladero.3.t:0 "La Sociedad de Carmelistas"
 dvg_caladero.3.d:0 "The Carmelistas"
 dvg_caladero.3.f:0 "When Spanish King Pedro III crushed Jose II’s liberals with Anglois assistance in 1815, the liberal revolutionaries of the Sociedad de Carmelistas fled abroad. They arrived in Quito in 1816 but failed to gain traction and dissolved by the 1820s. Now Manuel Sandino, an exile from western Spain, has founded a new Sociedad de Carmelistas. The Carmelistas are a group of Utopian liberals who are committed to many radical causes. They demand the subordination of the military to civilian leadership, wishing to strengthen the armed forces only insofar as they defend democracy. Carmelistas support a strong, centralized, secular, and protectionist government, but one confident enough to be able to devolve power onto local communities in certain cases. Strangest of all is their “Quitenese Dream,” which holds that Quito represents the synthesis of Andean and European civilization, the only foundation upon which true democracy can be built. While current laws force them to organize in secret they may pose a problem in the future."
 dvg_caladero.3.a:0 "How bizarre."
 dvg_caladero.4.t:0 "El Amigo del Pueblo"
 dvg_caladero.4.d:0 "The Románticos"
 dvg_caladero.4.f:0 "El Amigo del Pueblo is one of the most prominent newspapers in Quito, published by radical author Clodio Magno Puma Muyuroney. Unlike many other papers, which cater to the conservative aristocracy, El Amigo del Pueblo is a liberal-leaning newspaper with growing popularity among the small but notable Quitenese middle class. While our administration can certainly appreciate a diversity of viewpoints, the newspaper’s recent editorials have brought sharp criticism against the regime. They have criticized the Duke as being a “subservient appendage of Lisbon,” accusing him of courting public support yet remaining loyal to the upper classes and the aristocracy. Many of the articles are skirting Quitenese laws on supporting seditious groups. Quite a few upper class friends of the Duke of Tupac have urged him to shut the paper down, but he demurred, remaining aloof as to how he intended to respond."

 dvg_caladero.5.t:0 "Rumors About Muyuroney"
 dvg_caladero.5.d:0 "Muyuroney vs. Sandino"
 dvg_caladero.5.f:0 "News of the Carmelista secret society is hard to come by, but we believe they have undergone a change in leadership. The rising fame of El Amigo del Pueblo has brought equal fame to its proprietor, Muyuroney. It seems that the Carmelistas see him as more ambitious, confident, and passionate than Sandino. The latter remains a force within the movement, especially among its more moderate elements, but Muyuroney’s star appears ascendant. If rumors are to be believed, Muyuroney may have assumed leadership of the society itself, or at least eclipsed Sandino as its figurehead. While nothing is certain and both men still cannot be legally proven to be Carmelistas, what Sociedad communications we’ve identified speak of Muyuroney with newfound importance and mention Sandino far less often. This is rather concerning, as whereas Sandino was a more typical liberal ideologue, Muyuroney is a radical firebrand who has been fined for libel multiple times and just barely avoids imprisonment for seditious language."

 dvg_caladero.6.t:0 "An Open Letter to the Carmelist Gentlemen"
 dvg_caladero.6.d:0 "Románticos vs. Realistas"
 dvg_caladero.6.f:0 "In response to recent articles in El Amigo del Pueblo criticizing the viceroy, the Duke of Tupac has published a pamphlet countering the charges made against him by the liberals. Defending his record of “acting with fidelity as the obedient servant of all Quiteneses,” the Duke has denigrated the Carmelitas as being “overcome by delusions of grandeur,” “ensconced within ivory towers or candlelit basements,” and “utterly out of touch with the actual condition of the people and their needs…in short, mere romantics.” In contrast, the Duke writes, he and his loyalists represent “the only realistic course of the Quitenese government, one which responds to the condition of the nation and its people as they are, rather than as one may imagine them to be.” While the pamphlet has bolstered his support among the less radical elements of the population, it also seems to have backfired. Muyuroney has recently published an article in which the society he allegedly leads was for the first time referred to as the “Romanticos.”"

 dvg_caladero.7.t:0 "The Duke visits Chan Chan"
 dvg_caladero.7.d:0 "The Ducal Visit"
 dvg_caladero.7.f:0 "The Viceroy Dom Henrique has visited Chan Chan, capital of the Cajamarca province and home of the Chimu people. The city saw heavy fighting during the Battle of Chan Chan, also known as the? Battle of the Army of the Volunteers? owing to the multi-ethnic nature of the ad hoc army which the Duke rallied against Washkar Inca. The Chimu have a bitter history with Tawantinsuyu : they were rivals before being conquered by the legendary Inca emperor Pachacuti. When Spain undertook the Third Andine War in 1662, the Chimu defected in exchange for political privileges which they still enjoy because of the continuing warfare in the Andes. Most of the Chimu nobility, having married Criollo heiresses and converted to Christianity have been loyal to Spanish rule but they still cultivate a distinct identity as the 'noblest hidalgos of the continent'. The visit was seen as an effort to court the support of local lords against the Romanticos, with many veterans saluting the viceroy in memory of the victory he secured."

 dvg_caladero.8.t:0 "The Plan of [TimeKeeper.GetCurrentDate.GetString]"
 dvg_caladero.8.d:0 "The United Front"
 dvg_caladero.8.f:0 "The threat of the Spanish and the Inca has caused the unthinkable : The Duke of Tupac, Sandino, and Muyuroney have formed an alliance! All three have gathered in Quito, in conditions of great secrecy but which was rumored to be anything from a plan to kill the duke to a ploy to arrest the entire Romantico leadership. Instead, a stunning proclamation was issued in which the three political titans explained their intentions to join forces to protect Quito. Already, the Duke has confirmed the “total extinction” of any remaining ties to the Spanish crown. Several Romantico militias have already emerged from hiding to bolster the ranks of the existing military. While many doubt that this partnership can last any longer than is absolutely necessary, so long as they collaborate it seems like they might be able to unite the nation behind them."

 dvg_caladero.9.d:0 "Who shall lead Quito"
 dvg_caladero.9.f:0 "If we are to effectively lead an armed revolution then we must decide who shall command our forces. While all three members of the ruling triumvirate are in theory equal, Sandino was only included to keep the Romanticos united and has little military experience. Thus we must choose between the Duke of Tupac and Muyuroney. The Duke of Tupac’s charisma and excellent strategic and tactical mind is unquestioned, but he is still an aristocrat and vesting such power in him could be dangerous for our democracy. Muyuroney is less skilled, though still somewhat adept at offensive operations, and is a committed foe of monarchism, but is also conceited and vain. It is questionable if he could inspire the same confidence and loyalty as a general that he did as an author."

 dvg_caladero.10.f:0 "Our revolutionary army is taking shape but we need to establish how its men should be able to rise through the ranks. The Duke of Tupac, yielding to the vast liberal pressure amongst the coalition, has proposed that lower-rank officers be elected by their own soldiers, while higher-rank officers be promoted based upon their performance in the field. Though the Duke sees this as a compromise, it has unnerved the Romanticists, who are cognizant of the many incidents in history when revolutionary generals leveraged their reputations into seizing power. Thus they have proposed that revolutionary committees and their delegates  be the ones to monitor officers’ performance and recommend promotions, for the military high command to be democratically elected, and for civilians to be able to withdraw said commissions by recall vote. This system would be more resistant to tyranny and corruption but it would make Romantico values the army’s standard of conduct."

 dvg_caladero.11.d:0 "The Situation of the Local Nobility"
 dvg_caladero.11.f:0 "The curacas of Chimu and other coastal areas in Quito were formerly Inca magistrates who ruled ayllus, imperial family units, serving various roles such as tax collectors and priests. When Spain conquered the northern section of the Inca Empire, the curacas were allowed to keep significant privileges in exchange for assisting the administration. Now some have suggested folding the curacas into its command structure, since curacas, like all Inca nobles, were expected to be military leaders and many have served in our army in the past. This would strengthen our influence among native groups and increase our manpower, but to win their loyalty we would likely have to confirm their old privileges. The Romanticos may value Andean culture as part of the Quitenese identity, but they see the curacas as remnants of the old regimes which must be swept away. Therefore they have urged that we instead work to bring the curacas’ subjects into the army without their old lords, cultivating democracy and republicanism amongst the native peoples."

 dvg_caladero.12.f:0 "The triumvirate of Tupac, Sandino, and Muyuroney has finally fallen apart. Fissions are wracking the military and the civilian administration, and people throughout the nation are now taking sides. While outsiders might see these political issues as merely a binary divide between Realistas and Romanticos, in truth the Romanticos are also divided between Muyuroney’s loyalists and the liberal remnants of Sandino’s supporters. It would be far easier for Muyuroney to take power by making concessions to the less radical Romanticos rather than attempt to rule unopposed. Meanwhile, the Duke of Tupac seeks to put an end to the Romantico threat for good and consolidate power as an unrestricted leader of Quito. It soon becomes clear that the winner of the struggle is none other than…"

Sandino and Muyuroney were both executed for treason, and many of their compatriots are heading into prisons and graves across the nation. Some of these men resisted. Some of these men will never resist again. While the surviving Romanticos have gone back underground, the organization has been dealt a severe blow. Not satisfied with the crushing of his main rivals, the duke decided to put an end to representative democracy entirely. In an announcement before the Cortes Nacionale in Quito, he dissolved the assembly, and postponed elections to compose the new assembly “indefinitely.” Rumor has it that there will not, in fact, be any new elections at all, but that the duke shall select the new legislature personally. For he, with the military and the civil service behind him, is no longer a mere duke, or even a viceroy. He is a president – the undisputed President of Quito."

With the Romanticos in charge, pamphlets and broadsheets are being printed and distributed across Quito to bring the news of the revolution to the people. Across Quito, true local democracy is being established, all according to enlightened Romantico guidelines. And now that the revolution has been secured in Quito…"

To aggravate the matters, Presidente Sandino was shot by a former retainer of Tupac in broad daylight as he went to the Assembly to present a new plan of action for the Revolution. As the Constitution is not yet written, the radicals in the Assembly have demanded the establishment of a collective Autonomist Revolutionary Committee which should handle affairs of state with members elected by the Assembly every two months, while Don Willka has demanded that he should succeed Sandino as President of the Assembly and prevent the rise of anarchy with a shared executive.

Thus, he has reached out to the Romanticos through his own intermediaries to arrange a meeting with them. It took several weeks of touch-and-go exchanges, but Tupac was finally able to secure the audience of some of the highest-ranking Romanticos under conditions of strict secrecy. From the start, the meeting was tense, and it only got worse when the Romanticos laid out a series of demands upon which their assistance would be contingent. Enfranchisement of the natives, nationalization of the largest church estates, and a democratically elected military high command were some of their most notable points. The meeting concluded with…"

Washkar led a retaliatory rampage all the way to Chan Chan, defeated only by the timely arrival of the Duke of Tupac and his ad hoc army of Quitan, Chimu, Quechua, and Spanish forces. However, with de Blanco once again waging war against Spain, another one of de Herrera’s old compatriots has returned from hiding. An army of Balliviánists, supplied by de Blanco, has stormed into Quito, with Ballivián himself arriving in Quito on a whaling ship.

Native, mestizo, and Spanish communities all burned with rage at the thought of the man who laid waste to their homes now ruling them. In the face of Ballivián’s dictatorship, the Romanticists used their secret societies to rally anti-Ballivián sentiment across Quito, and the Realists agreed to an emergency alliance to save the nation. This led to the formation of a multi-ethnic Second Army of the Volunteers, inspired by the ad hoc force which defeated Washkar Inca. Yesterday, they launched revolts throughout the Quito countryside before converging upon the city. Ballivián sallied forth with his loyalists, but the Volunteers shattered the dictator’s army and seized Ballivián, trying, convicting, and executing him for treason. A new government has been formed, and with the Realists sidelined, the Romanticists have taken the lead in bringing revolutionary democracy to Quito."

After the Crown announced its recognition of the independence of the Colombian Confederation, and the dissolution of the Golden Board of Atlantia, the Romanticists escalated their liberal rhetoric. This has culminated in a series of protests in Quito to object to Spain’s onerous rule. They focused on three points : first, that it was Quiteneses, not Spaniards, who won the day against Washkar Inca, second, that Spain had never acknowledged or healed Cisandina damage during the War of 1826, and third, that a Crown-appointed caudillo and emphasis on Lisbon’s role in administration is an obsolete system in need of reform. The decision to hold the protests on the 5th of March was especially provocative : the First Mexican Republic was proclaimed on that day in Mexico City in 1817.

Tupac has proven a mercurial caudillo, one with dubious political ideas who continues to push the limits of acceptable conduct for a viceroy. Recently, protests have erupted against our rule in Quito, and Viceroy Tupac has been alarmingly slow to retaliate against them. Furthermore, Spanish officers in Quito have reported suspicious activity between known Quitenese radicals and individuals believed to be affiliated with de Blanco.
