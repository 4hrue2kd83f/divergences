 dvg_cape_colony.1.t: "The Dissolution of the Cape"
 dvg_cape_colony.1.d: "Having lost the bulk of our military during the Geuzen rebellions, the remaining part of the cape under control of Burgundy is in total dissaray"
 dvg_cape_colony.1.f: "The humiliation of losing a war to the Viceroy's bastard son, the death the only heir and the destruction of his military; the Burgundian crown was left with no choice but to dissolve the viceroyalty and establish a directly appointed colonial administration. " 
 dvg_cape_colony.1.a: "The Geus seem to be getting louder by the day"
 
 #Appointment of the Governor
 dvg_cape_colony.2.t: "Appointment of the Governor"
 dvg_cape_colony.2.d: "When the new colonial administration was established, Brugundy sent an administrator, Gillebert Pierlot, to act as the interim governor while the new administration was establishing itself. Now that all of the positions in the government are filled, Burgundy must decide who should lead the reconquest of the cape. Who do we recommend?"
 dvg_cape_colony.2.f: "Gillebert Pierlot has proven himself to be a competent administrator. Instituting a 'government from afar' policy towards the Geus and native Africans; affording them a generous degree of autonomy. He believes that giving these communities nothing to resist will eventually result in them returning to work and engaging with the Burgundian economy. On the other hand; Commander Regnault Courvoisier is a prime military condidate to fill the governorship. He advocates for swift and violent reprisals against the rebellious Geuzen people, and aggresive settler colonisation to secure Burgundian control. Having already drawn up plans to recapture Ylnerdam from Aloysius, he is the favoured choice among hardliners in the Burgundian court. " 
 dvg_cape_colony.2.a: "The moderate Pierlot"
 dvg_cape_colony.2.b: "The militarist Courvoisier"

 #Burgundy accepts the moderate
 dvg_cape_colony.3.t: "Burgundy accepts our recommendation"
 dvg_cape_colony.3.d: "The Burgundian crown has accepted our recommendation to keep Pierlot as governor"
 dvg_cape_colony.3.f: "In a ceremony inside the palace of the former Duke, Pierlot was oficially confirmed as the first governor of the Cape. In his speech he discussed an amnesty for rebelling Geuzen settlements, extending diplomatic recognition toward the republic of Vryland, as well as offering protection to the Native tribes of the Cape." 
 dvg_cape_colony.3.a: "Who says colonisation has to be violent?"

 #Burgundy rejects the moderate
 dvg_cape_colony.4.t: "Burgundy rejects our recommendation!"
 dvg_cape_colony.4.d: "Regnault Courvoisier arrived today to deliver Brugundy's response, in which Pierlot recieved a commendation from the crown for his service; shortly before being dismissed as governor"
 dvg_cape_colony.4.f: "While inspecting the palace of the former duke, Courvoisier made several comments insulting Pierlot's government and masculinity, before comandeering the palace and ordering that the breurecrats within it be relocated elsewhere in Ville du Cap. In an extravagant ceremony outside his palace the following day, Regnault gave an hour-long speech declaring that the Geus will pay for resisting the Burgundian throne, and that all of Southern Africa is destined for Burgundian rule" 
 dvg_cape_colony.4.a: "The Geus won't stand a chance"

 #Burgundy accepts the militarist
 dvg_cape_colony.5.t: "Burgundy accepts our recommendation"
 dvg_cape_colony.5.d: "Regnault Courvoisier arrived today to relieve Pierlot from duty"
 dvg_cape_colony.5.f: "While inspecting the palace of the former duke, Courvoisier made several backhanded comments regarding Pierlot's 'dainty' lodgings, before comandeering the palace and ordering that the breurecrats within it be relocated elsewhere in Ville du Cap. In an extravagant ceremony outside his palace the following day, Regnault gave an hour-long speech declaring that the Geus will pay for resisting the Burgundian throne, and that all of Southern Africa is destined for Burgundian rule" 
 dvg_cape_colony.5.a: "The Geus won't stand a chance"

 dvg_cape_colony.6.t: "Burgundy rejects our recommendation!"
 dvg_cape_colony.6.d: "Fearing that a firmer hand will only inflame the cape further, the Crown has decided to keep Courvoisier on the mainland"
 dvg_cape_colony.6.f: "In a ceremony inside the palace of the former Duke, Pierlot was oficially confirmed as the first governor of the Cape. In a rather awkard speech to the beurecrats that recommended his removal he discussed an amnesty for rebelling Geuzen settlements, extending diplomatic recognition toward the republic of Vryland, as well as offering protection to the Native tribes of the Cape." 
 dvg_cape_colony.6.a: "It probably wasn't personal"
