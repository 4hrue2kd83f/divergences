Riding on horseback through the shocked masses, he headed towards Donghua Gate to receive the imperial regalia; [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] was then escorted to Wuying Palace by the former [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SHU').GetName] imperial bodyguards, who had previously submitted to [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SHU').GetRuler.GetFullName] but now vowed to serve the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName].
