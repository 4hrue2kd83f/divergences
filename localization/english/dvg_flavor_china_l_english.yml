 law_china_feudal_armies_desc:0 "Originally developed by the Yuan, the Ming and latter Shun inherited the Wei-Suo system to help guard it's borders, by creating military households along the frontiers. However it is horribly out of date as soldiers are more loyal to thir officers-latrons rather than the throne and as such uninterested in warfare, preventing any type of efficient mobilisation."

 decline_of_great_shun.1.d:0 "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is in a period of deep decline. We must muster what we can in order to weather the storm fast approaching."
 decline_of_great_shun.1.f:0 "After winning the battle of Shanhai Pass, crushing both the Ming remnants and the Jin, the Shun solidified their control over most of China. Initially the Shun went through a brief age of prosperity; however, the Ming remnant retreated to the island of Formosa and in the dense mountains of Yunnan, meanwhile the Manchu have been stiffly resisting Shun. Unable to full conquer China, more and more control was delegated to the provincial governments. This has led to a weak ineffective empire that can barely control its own territory, let alone resist the attacks and ambitions of foreigners. The Cheng Emperor despite this, ordered the attack of Formosa in 1820. Then in 1823 catastrophic floods around the Pearl River Basin cased wide-spread famine in the south, to make matters worst the central government was unable or unwilling to give aid. The Tungning took advantage, and regained control of much of the coast using the "Kong-Gao" a new breech-loading single-shot rifle developed in collaboration with the Dual Monarchy, and their grand navy. The chaos in the south was only further exacerbated by this, with various god-worshipping societies forming as missionaries from Europe helped during the famine. Soon, all forms of Christianity would be banned since Emperor Cheng saw Christians as a threat to national security. Christians were soon pushed away from the center of Shun power, centralizing in Guangdong, forming an independent republic with the Shun powerless to stop them. The Empire is humiliated, weak and divided, our subjects whisper that the mandate has been lost, and our vassals in the south only pay lip service to us."
