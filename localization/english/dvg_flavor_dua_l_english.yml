  je_midi_revolution_reason:0 "The Midi - the region of the Midday Sun, is certainly one of our most picturesque Crown Lands. Its inhabitants, the Provencal, however, have always felt stranged, being alien to not only the Anglois elite in Paris but also the French. Many have now begun to agitate for an independent Occitan state."

  dvg_dua.1.t:0 "The Anglois Dilemma"
  dvg_dua.1.d:0 "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is on a crossroad."
  dvg_dua.1.f:0 "Ever since the Treaty of Rome in 1498, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has had to walk a fine line in not favouring one of its ethnic groups over the others. Recent censi have shown that the English and French represent around one-fifth of the population. What is more threatening to either group is not the other but rather a growing group calling themselves Anglois. These groups have created the dilemma for the monarchy in who to favor. There are those in power that believe that it is best to pick a side while others believe that the Anglois ideology of blending the best customs of English and French is the way of the future."
  dvg_dua.1.a:0 "We are kings of France and England!"
  dvg_dua.2.t:0 "The Anglo-French monarchy"
  dvg_dua.2.d:0 "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is on a crossroad."
  dvg_dua.2.f:0 "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] throne has endured! Despite the threat of radicals, nationalists and foreign power, all its people stands ready to serve their country! The coming decades will surely be Anglois for who can stand against the combined force of the Dual-Monarchy of France and England?"
  dvg_dua.2.a:0 "Eventually we prevail!"
  dvg_dua.3.t:0 "Failure of the Anglois model"
  dvg_dua.3.d:0 "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] failed."

  dvg_dua.101.t:0 "The Matter of the Anglois"
  dvg_dua.101.d:0 "After being completely alienated in favor of a metropolitan minority, obtaining peace between the angry French and English mobs will not be an easy task."
  dvg_dua.101.f:0 "Our wise ruler. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName], knows it very well. The French and English despise each other, but the only thing bigger than their hate against each other is their hate for Paris, and especially the Anglois, who for them, are a complete abomination. So if both of them were to rally against the new Anglois order, it would be disastrous. Trying times are head, our government must tread extremely carefully, for a full blown revolution by either of majority groups, would be completely disastrous for our nation and would most certainly spell our undoing."
  dvg_dua.101.a:0 "The Dual Monarchy will stand"

  dvg_dua.110.t:0 "Choosing a Patron"
  dvg_dua.110.d:0 "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] has to choose an historical figure to honor in the coming months."
  dvg_dua.110.f:0 "Several proposals have emerged: Alfred the Great, the old Saxon king is admired by many across the Channel, Louis XI the Holy is seen as a benevolent figure here on the continent, Edouard IV was the first Plantagenet born in Paris and thus is seen as both a rallying figure for the Anglois but also a usurper for the French and a traitor for the English. No matter who the King chooses to honour it will not please everyone."
  dvg_dua.110.a:0 "St-Louis is worthy of our recognition"
  dvg_dua.110.b:0 "Alfred the Great is worthy of our recognition"
  dvg_dua.110.c:0 "Edouard IV is worthy of our recognition"
  dvg_dua.111.t:0 "Histoire de la France depuis ses origines"
  dvg_dua.111.d:0 "The historian Pierre Guizot has published a new book upon the history of France."
  dvg_dua.111.f:0 "The book has received a warm response from French scholars for its exhaustivity. But its portrayal of English and early Plantagenets is quite troublesome and his idea of 'a distinct spirit existing since the Gauls' War' only amuses the French nationalists."
  dvg_dua.111.a:0 "He makes some interesting points"
  dvg_dua.111.b:0 "And he calls his book historic?"
  dvg_dua.112.t:0 "Saxon poetry"
  dvg_dua.112.d:0 "An anthology of English poetry has been published in Cambridge by the Sons of Harold."
  dvg_dua.112.f:0 "Regrouping old and new poets alike, this book has become widely applaused in England but many scholars from Paris consider it a complete waste of time."
  dvg_dua.112.a:0 "A truly wonderful piece of art!"
  dvg_dua.112.b:0 "As I said before, English is not fit for poetry."
  dvg_dua.113.t:0 "Travel of the Dauphin"
  dvg_dua.113.d:0 "The Travel of the Dauphin promises to be a grand and exciting event, full of pomp and ceremony."
  dvg_dua.113.f:0 "The young Dauphine of France and Princess of Wales is set to embark on a journey across the length and breadth of the kingdom, visiting its great cities, historic landmarks, and stunning natural landscapes. The trip will be marked by a series of lavish celebrations, including banquets, balls, and parades, as well as meetings with important dignitaries, influential artists, and leading intellectuals. Everywhere the Dauphine goes, she will be greeted by cheering crowds, who will wave flags and throw flowers in her path. From the bustling streets of Paris to the windswept cliffs of Brittany, this will be a journey to remember, and one that will cement the Dauphine's place as the future ruler of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
  dvg_dua.113.a:0 "This will be a journey to remember"
  dvg_dua.114.t:0 "Les Immortels"
  dvg_dua.114.d:0 "One of the Immortals seat is vacated."
  dvg_dua.114.f:0 "The Royal Academy, founded in the XVIIth century to host the greatest literary minds of the whole kingdom, has since evolved to codify the official language of the monarchy. One of the Immortals seats has been vacated, and we need to nominate someone. Although Tolsmith is a Saxon, he is recognized as one of the greatest philologists in the kingdom. In Occitania, the poet Jasmin has succeeded in captivating the minds of the court. However, the grammarian Morel could be nominated to demonstrate our desire for uniformity."
  dvg_dua.114.a:0 "Tolsmith could give us another perspective."
  dvg_dua.114.b:0 "The Occitan poet Jasmin is a good candidate"
  dvg_dua.114.c:0 "Nominate the proud Anglois grammarian Morel"
  dvg_dua.115.t:0 "Celebration of the German Revolution"
  dvg_dua.115.d:0 "Radicals in the Kingdom are preparing for the 55th anniversary of the First German Revolution."
  dvg_dua.115.f:0 "Some advisors have talked about allowing them to do so to better control them but if we do so then it will cost us our relations with the Bohemian court... Forbidding them to commemorate and organizing great ceremonies remembering the prowess of our armies during the ensuing wars would certainly be a good symbol of unity."
  dvg_dua.115.a:0 "If it can please these liberals."
  dvg_dua.115.b:0 "We won't associate with these monsters!"
  dvg_dua.116.t:0 "The Dual Springtime"
  dvg_dua.116.d:0 "The "Springtime of Nations" threatens to upon our delicate balance."
  dvg_dua.116.f:0 "As revolution and upheaval sweep across Europe, many in the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] fear that the ideals of nationalism and self-determination will undermine their efforts at integration. Some worry that the rising tide of democracy and popular sovereignty will undermine the power of the monarch, while others fear that ethnic and linguistic divisions will tear the kingdom apart.\n\nDespite these challenges, the proponents of the Anglois ideology remain resolute in their commitment to a united and prosperous future for England and France. They believe that the shared values and traditions of the two nations will ultimately triumph over the forces of division and chaos, and that the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] will emerge stronger and more united than ever before."
  dvg_dua.116.a:0 "The Revolution will not anihilate our efforts!"
  dvg_dua.117.t:0 "End of the Springtime"
  dvg_dua.117.d:0 "The ongoing 'Springtime of Nations' that swept across Europe and threatened the stability of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] have finally come to a halt in our kingdom."
  dvg_dua.117.f:0 "This is a testament to the resilience and strength of our nation, and to the effectiveness of the policies and ideologies that have guided us through this challenging period.\n\nWhile other nations may have succumbed to the forces of revolution and upheaval, we have remained steadfast.\n\nThe fact that the 'Springtime of Nations' has stopped in our kingdom is a cause for celebration, but it is also a warning to remain vigilant and continue to build upon our achievements. We must work to strengthen the bonds of unity and shared identity that bind us together as a nation.\n\nIn the end, it is our resilience and determination that will carry us forward into a brighter and more prosperous future."
  dvg_dua.117.a:0 "We are strong!"
  dvg_dua.118.t:0 "Liberal agitations"
  dvg_dua.118.d:0 "The emergence of liberal and nationalist societies on both sides of the Channel is a reflection of the growing tensions and divisions within our kingdom."
  dvg_dua.118.f:0 "Liberals and Nationalists from both sides of the Channel have formed societies aimed at spreading their ideas. If we allow them, the Sons of Harold may provoke problems in our territories and promote English Nationalism, while Saint Louis may seek to promote French nationalism."
  dvg_dua.118.a:0 "These organisations must be watched closely"
  dvg_dua.118.b:0 "Ban both of them!"
  dvg_dua.119.t:0 "Provencal Problems"
  dvg_dua.119.d:0 "Tolon is a nest of problems for our state. "
  dvg_dua.119.f:0 "The kings in-France publish propaganda serving them and give them to agents who easily cross the border. Ending the Provencal state seems the only way to stop this state of affairs."
  dvg_dua.119.a:0 "We must put an end to the Valois problem"
  dvg_dua.120.t:0 "A Revolutionary for Our Time"
  dvg_dua.120.d:0 "A voice for the liberalism currently on the rise has resonated with the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('radical_ig').GetName]."
  dvg_dua.120.f:0 ""I don't know what to make of this new style of politics. It seems tactless to make demands this recklessly."\n\n"When one argues that the premises for what constitutes political tact are themselves flawed, a bit of tactlessness can help drive home the point.""
  dvg_dua.120.a:0 "It must be heard."
  dvg_dua.120.a.tt:0 "A #bold Radical#! character will assume leadership of the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('radical_ig').GetName]."
  dvg_dua.121.t:0 "Scottish problems"
  dvg_dua.121.d:0 "Troubles on the Northern Border."
  dvg_dua.121.f:0 "Our Northern Border allows the worste of the English elements to find support, weapons or shelter in Scotland. Unless we take control of Scotland, directly or indirectly, the situation could worsen."
  dvg_dua.121.a:0 "Scotland should be ours to avoid further problems!"
  dvg_dua.122.t:0 "Resilience of the Anglois idea"
  dvg_dua.122.d:0 "For 20 years the monarchy has encouraged the unity of the peoples on each side of the Channel."

  dvg_dua.500.f:0 "Now, Revolters have swarmed the streets of the great cities of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] in a scale not seen since the First German Revolution! The nationalist rebels are decided to end the monarchy in blood if necessary and with it the very idea of the Anglois dream."

  dvg_dua.510.f:0 "Its inhabitants, the Provençal, however, have always felt stranged, being alien to not only the Anglois elite in Paris but also the French. Moreover, the Valois Dynasty, while still retaining its ancient claim to the French throne, has acquired an increasingly Provençal character after being territorially reduced over the centuries to just Provence proper, and thus has become a source of agitation for our Provençal subjects. As our Monarchy is cracking at the steams due to the centripetal forces of English and French Nationalism, the Provençal have finally decided to hedge their bets. With outright revolution facing us from the mouth of the Loire to the Côte d'Azur, we must prepare for the inevitable conflict."
  dvg_dua.510.a:0 "The Provencaux will regret this!"

  dvg_dua.520.d:0 "Tensions in our English territories have reached a boiling point as all our attempts to placate the nationalists have failed."
  dvg_dua.520.f:0 "It all started with a Garrison in Liverpool declaring the authority of the Monarchy in Paris to be void - and like a wildfire, rebellion spread all over Northern England, coalescing into a self-proclaimed Provisional English Republic.
