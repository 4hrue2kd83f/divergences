 dvg_dzungaria.1.t: "The Khanate"
 dvg_dzungaria.1.d:  "The Khanate of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is the last great remnant of the Mongolian Empire. Founded by Oirat Mongols, in the XVIIth century it grew in importance in the following century unifying the Mongolian camps and vainquishing the Manchus during several campaigns."
 dvg_dzungaria.1.f: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] converted to Islam following his conquests of Samarkand and Khiva but has shown tolerance towards the Buddhists lamas of his realm. While already aged he has said he wanted to advance into China but already his sons want to divide the khanate following their desires."
 dvg_dzungaria.1.a: "We will lead the Steppes peoples to greatness!"
 
 dvg_dzungaria.2.t: "The Death of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] "
 dvg_dzungaria.2.d: "The supreme chief of the Asian steppe died yesterday at the venerable age of 76 years."
 dvg_dzungaria.2.f: "The size of the ate combined with the ambitions of his sons has seen the Empire already divided  each army pledging an oath to a different son. The heir Tushiyetu has seized the crown lands of Dzungaria but he now must choose: will he try to stop his brothers’ ambition or will he completely let the Empire disrupt?"
 dvg_dzungaria.2.a: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] Must Stay Together."
 dvg_dzungaria.2.b: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] should only be ruled by people from [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_MGL').GetName]"
 dvg_dzungaria.2.c: "[SCOPE.sCountry('scope_UZB').GetName] shall rule its rightful steppes once more!"
 dvg_dzungaria.2.ab: "[SCOPE.sCountry('scope_KAZ').GetName] can only be rule by Kazakhs!"
 dvg_dzungaria.2.aa: "[SCOPE.sCountry('scope_KOK').GetName] deserves a place on the world stage!"
 dvg_dzungaria.2.ac: "[SCOPE.sCountry('scope_XIN').GetName] will finally achieve independence!"
 
 dvg_dzungaria.3.t: "The Khanate Stays Strong"
 dvg_dzungaria.3.d:  "The worries that the new heir would not be respected have turned out to be mostly false. "
 dvg_dzungaria.3.f: "If anything, the recent expansion of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] into China has shown that the hopes of becoming a great empire have not faded away."
 dvg_dzungaria.3.a: "To Khanbaliq!"

 dvg_dzungaria.4.t: "The Khanate's Religion"
 dvg_dzungaria.4.d:  "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] puts it at a crossroads to two very different religions - Buddhism and Islam."
 dvg_dzungaria.4.f: "Although Galdan Khan himself converted to Islam, he has been reluctant to enforce it as a state religion. Many Mongols have stayed devout Buddhists, with much of Mongolian nobility believing there are reincarnations of living Buddhas within their families. In fact, our current relationship with Tibet is deeply connected with this. \n\n  However, Islam still remains popular among the other ethnic groups within our realm - the Uzbeks, Tajiks, Kazakhs, among others. Changing the khanate's state religion isn't precedented - The khans of the Chagatai, Ilkhanate, and Golden Horde converted Islam with respect to their governed populations while Kublai Khan of the Yuan Dynasty converted to Tibetan Buddhism and his subsequent descendants in Dzungaria and the Mongol heartland have remained so."
 dvg_dzungaria.4.a: "Like Kublai Khan and how Dzungars have always been, we will remain a Buddhist nation."
 dvg_dzungaria.4.b: "Like the Khans of the west, we shall embrace Islam. Inshallah!"
