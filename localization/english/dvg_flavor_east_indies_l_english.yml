 je_simple_conquer_sumatra: "Unite Sumatra"
 je_simple_conquer_sumatra_reason: "Sumatra has been slowly coming under the control of Europeans in the past hundred years, and as a Burgundian presence has expanded in our south, many amongst us worry that we are next on the chopping block. We still have time however, our independence is not yet lost, and we can still strike the Burgundians to regain our territory should the opportunity arise!"
 je_simple_conquer_java: "Unite Java"
 je_simple_conquer_java_reason: "Our control on our island has gradually been diminishing. Long gone are the ages where our kings ruled uncontested over Java, and now, a Burgundian presence has gradually made its way into our land. This cannot be allowed to continue, lest we find ourselves stripped completely of our right to rule."
 je_simple_conquer_borneo: "Unite Borneo"
 je_simple_conquer_borneo_reason: "The island of Borneo has for the most part avoided European colonization so far. However, the Burgundians have built a small presence in the east of our island. This cannot be allowed to continue, we must drive them out before we find ourselves chattel under a Burgundian, or Scandinavian Yoke."
 je_simple_build_navy: "Build Naval Presence"
 je_simple_build_navy_reason: "The Europeans shall come to us first on the seas, this much is inevitable. If we can ensure a dominant naval power in our region, even just to the level of a coast guard, we can establish our waters as something not to be sailed through without resistance by Europeans!"
 je_simple_build_military: "Westernize Army"
 je_simple_build_military_reason: "Whilst the Europeans will fight us first at sea, we hold no illusion that it will end there. They will come for our land, and we must be ready to die protecting it. However, past conflicts with Europeans have proven the inadequacy of our current military. We must reform and modernize it, lest we succumb to their invasions."
 je_simple_urbanize_nation: "Urbanize Country"
 je_simple_urbanize_nation_reason: "Our lands are spread out and agricultural in nature. We must ensure that our lands become more urbanized, to better build and prepare our country for the coming attacks. Our land must be secured and united in heart, belief, and spirit!
 je_simple_educate_population: "Educate Our People"
 je_simple_educate_population_reason: "In order to step into the future, we must ensure our literacy rates are raised, and universities built to house a new class of intellectuals."
 je_retaking_java:0 "Retaking Java" 
 je_retaking_java_reason:0 "The first step to establishing the old empire again is to cement a foothold on our former homeland of Java."

 dvg_bali.1.f:0 "As the sole Hindu nation amongst a sea of sultanates and encroaching colonial powers, Bali has a difficult road ahead of it if it wants to be recognized as the old empire's successor. \n \n Seeing the success in uniting Bali and the Sunda Islands under his authority, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] dynasty hopes to do the same with the rest of the East Indies.
