 je_simple_conquer_sumatra: "Unite Sumatra"
 je_simple_conquer_sumatra_reason: "Sumatra has been slowly coming under the control of Europeans in the past hundred years, and as a Burgundian presence has expanded in our south, many amongst us worry that we are next on the chopping block. We still have time however, our independence is not yet lost, and we can still strike the Burgundians to regain our territory should the opportunity arise!"
 je_simple_conquer_java: "Unite Java"
 je_simple_conquer_java_reason: "Our control on our island has gradually been diminishing. Long gone are the ages where our kings ruled uncontested over Java, and now, a Burgundian presence has gradually made its way into our land. This cannot be allowed to continue, lest we find ourselves stripped completely of our right to rule."
 je_simple_conquer_borneo: "Unite Borneo"
 je_simple_conquer_borneo_reason: "The island of Borneo has for the most part avoided European colonization so far. However, the Burgundians have built a small presence in the east of our island. This cannot be allowed to continue, we must drive them out before we find ourselves chattel under a Burgundian, or Scandinavian Yoke."
 je_simple_build_navy: "Build Naval Presence"
 je_simple_build_navy_reason: "The Europeans shall come to us first on the seas, this much is inevitable. If we can ensure a dominant naval power in our region, even just to the level of a coast guard, we can establish our waters as something not to be sailed through without resistance by Europeans!"
 je_simple_build_military: "Westernize Army"
 je_simple_build_military_reason: "Whilst the Europeans will fight us first at sea, we hold no illusion that it will end there. They will come for our land, and we must be ready to die protecting it. However, past conflicts with Europeans have proven the inadequacy of our current military. We must reform and modernize it, lest we succumb to their invasions."
 je_simple_urbanize_nation: "Urbanize Country"
 je_simple_urbanize_nation_reason: "Our lands are spread out and agricultural in nature. We must ensure that our lands become more urbanized, to better build and prepare our country for the coming attacks. Our land must be secured and united in heart, belief, and spirit!
 je_simple_educate_population: "Educate Our People"
 je_simple_educate_population_reason: "In order to step into the future, we must ensure our literacy rates are raised, and universities built to house a new class of intellectuals."
 je_retaking_java: "Retaking Java" 
 je_retaking_java_reason: "The first step to establishing the old empire again is to cement a foothold on our former homeland of Java."

 dvg_east_indies.2.d: "The Europeans shall come to us first on the seas, this much is inevitable. If we can ensure a dominant naval power in our region, even just to the level of a coast guard, we can establish our waters as something not to be sailed through without resistance by Europeans!"

 dvg_bali.1.t: "The United Kingdom of Bali"
 dvg_bali.1.d: "Centuries have passed following the fall of the Majapahit Empire, yet some political leaders living in its former territory (known as the Nusantara) are still nostalgic for its legacy of uniting the indies. One of these leaders is [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName], who has become the embodiment of the Balinese kingdoms uniting."
 dvg_bali.1.f: "Just like the old empire, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has managed to maintain Hinduism as the state religion and thus sits alone in doing so being surrounded by a sea of sultanates and colonial powers. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] difficult road ahead of it if it wants to be taken seriously as the re-uniter of the Nusantara. \n \n Seeing the success in uniting Bali and the Sunda Islands, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] dynasty hopes to do the same with the rest of the East Indies. However, even many of our leader's loyal supporters consider this idea far-fetched. Outmanned by the other regional powers and technologically behind the Europeans, our leader still believes such ambitions are possible." 
 dvg_bali.1.a: "We might be alone, but we are not dead!"

 dvg_bali.2.t: "Java Secured"

 dvg_bali.2.f: "What was initially considered just a jingoist fever dream has become a reality. Now, are we seriously going to try to reclaim the entire empire, or maybe we should just focus on controlling this island for now?" 
 dvg_bali.2.a: "Let's not get too ahead of ourselves."
 dvg_bali.2.b: "All of the Indies will fly under the flag of the Maharaja!"
 
 dvg_polynesia.1.t: "The T'ui Tonga Empire"
 dvg_polynesia.1.d: "Despite being a largely unopposed hegemonic power since the 10th century, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] Empire is largely unknown outside of the region."
 dvg_polynesia.1.f: "Still, this humble yet mighty nation gets by from being a stopping point for ships trying to cross the Pacific, whether they be merchants going between Zhourao and Qingqiu, European explorers hoping to 'discover' and claim new lands, or missionaries converting us to their religion through the education they provide. For much of our history, we have been an observer nation to these developments in the outside world. Of course, with all this observing comes knowledge that surely we can put to good use!" 
 dvg_polynesia.1.a: "Is it Tonga time? I think it's Tonga time!"
