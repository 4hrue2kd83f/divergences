 dvg_gran_colombia.1.d:0 "The Colombian Alliance!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.1.f:0 "For centuries, Spain has ruled its colonies with the greed and heartlessness of an absentee landlord. The liberal King Jose II usurped the Spanish throne in 1808 and seemed willing to increase colonial trade and local elites’ power, but the Dual Monarchy backed the absolutist pretender Pedro III against Jose. After taking the throne in 1815 at the end of the brutal Peninsular War, Pedro issued the Petrine “Reforms.” The Reforms strangled domestic colonial trade and confirmed the status of European-born peninsulares as the colonial elite despite calls for local representation. The crushing of the revolutionary First Mexican Republic by Spain in 1817 lit the flame of independence throughout Spain’s colonies, who formed the Colombian Alliance, led by liberal Anastasio Vicente, to win their freedom. We are currently observing an armistice with Spain, but war may soon return. Some whisper of fractures within the Alliance, but so long as the Spanish crown still seeks to destroy us, we must unite for the sake of liberty!"

 dvg_gran_colombia.2.f:0 "The Independence of New Toledo has sent ripples throughout Arcadia and Ameriga, and these ripples have finally reached Mexico City. The Colombian Alliance wants independence from the Spanish Crown and has been granted support from their New Toledo peers, leaving New Granada as the sole remaining loyal Viceroyalty in the New World. We must bring freedom to Colombia, and if God wills it, to Granada as well."

 dvg_gran_colombia.4.f:0 "With the failure of the combined forces of Grã-Colômbia and New Toledo to beat the Spanish, the Colombian Alliance is dissolved and the Viceroyalty is reinstated. Rumours abound of a new era of Spanish dominance over not only Ameriga, but Arcadia as well..."

 # dvg_gran_colombia.6.d:0 "Herreria Calls for Aid"
 # dvg_gran_colombia.6.f:0 "Guillermo de Blanco has finally emerged from hiding and led his guerillas into Bogota, capping off a period of raiding and recruitment that has seen his band of followers swell into a true revolutionary army. He has now declared the Republic of Herreria, named after the “Father of the Revolution,” José de Herrera, and is engaged in a fight for the fate of New Granada against the Spanish. As we share his animosity towards Spain, de Blanco has petitioned us to aid him, and to join forces against the Spanish Crown. If he is successful, then perhaps we could leverage this into Herreria joining the Colombian Alliance, finally securing the massive, revolutionary New World state of de Herrera’s dreams. Of course, more pessimistic, cynical ministers see de Blanco as a power-mad brute, infamous for his hatred of the Incas and more likely to be a liability than an ally. Still, surely a free Herreria is preferable to a hostile New Granada?"

 dvg_gran_colombia.7.d:0 "Grand Opening of the Colombian Navy"
 dvg_gran_colombia.7.f:0 "Wonderful news, my caudilho! We have recently finished with our project to build up a proper Colombian navy. During the Colombian War of Independence, we couldn't reach Kuba due to lack of navy against the Spanish Armada despite the Cuban's contribution to the revolution. With our newly created navy, hopefully we can reunite with our Cuban compatriots against Spanish imperialism once again."

 dvg_gran_colombia.8.f:0 "Great news! We have recently liberated Kuba from the Spanish once and for all. During the Colombian War of Independence, we couldn't reach Kuba due to lack of navy against the Spanish Armada despite the Cuban's contribution to the revolution. Since the Spanish are distracted by nationalist problems at home, we managed to liberate Kuba from their grasp, ending centuries of Spanish rule on the island."

 dvg_gran_colombia.9.f:0 "More news, my caudilho! After months of campaigning, we have recently conquered Granada. During the Colombian War of Independence, Granada was once a Spanish loyalist stronghold, but with the Spanish withdrawal, Granada remains no match to our might once we marched down to Medellín. Despite our liberation, we are currently facing resistance in Granada and we must quell it down before we could advance to our next target."

 dvg_gran_colombia.10.f:0 "Despite the difficulties that we faced so far, we have recently pacified Granada for good. The Granadan resistance has cited nationalist reasons such as cultural and language differences between the Colombian and the Granadan, and that they wish to remain independent from Colombia. Luckily, our persuasion campaign to the Granadan populace has paid off with many Granadans agreed to join our cause for a greater Colombia."

 dvg_gran_colombia.11.d:0 "The Conquest of New Toledo"
 dvg_gran_colombia.11.f:0 "Even more wonderful news! We have recently finished our liberation of New Toledo. Despite the New Toledans' contribution to our liberation of Granada from Spanish rule, they have remained hesitant with joining Colombia. Since our liberation, we have began sending officials to convince the New Toledans on supporting to unification of Colombia and New Toledo."

 dvg_gran_colombia.12.d:0 "Military Policy"
 dvg_gran_colombia.12.f:0 "Since Spain no longer controls continental Ameriga and Arcardia, let us focus on our military relation with Granada and New Toledo. One option is a full military alliance between the three nations. Another option is to form a defensive pact between the three nations. The last option would be to keep relation at arm's length to avoid any complications when either Granada or New Toledo is at war."
 dvg_gran_colombia.12.a:0 "Let us cement the Colombian alliance!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.12.b:0 "Let us keep it as a defensive pact."
 dvg_gran_colombia.12.c:0 "It is best to keep the relation at arm's length."
 dvg_gran_colombia.13.t:0 "Foreign Policy"
 dvg_gran_colombia.13.d:0 "Trade Policy"
 dvg_gran_colombia.13.f:0 "Since we are done with the military policy, let us focus on trade policy. Considering that all three nations are underdeveloped currently, one proposal would be to establish a custom union so all three nations can have access to each other's market. Another option is to establish trade agreements between the three nations to allow reduced tariffs for trade goods while ensuring that the three nations' markets remain independent. The third option is to do neither as the Colombian market would not benefit from either deals."
 dvg_gran_colombia.13.a:0 "Let us form a custom union!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.13.b:0 "A trade agreement would suffice."
 dvg_gran_colombia.13.c:0 "On second thought, maybe this is not necessary."
 dvg_gran_colombia.14.t:0 "Vicente's Trouble"
 dvg_gran_colombia.14.d:0 "The Fate of Vicente"
 dvg_gran_colombia.14.f:0 "President Anastasio Vicente has been under an unusual amount of stress lately. Rural landowners and provincial caudillos are beginning to express opposition to any reform of the current, massively decentralized system, alarmed by Vicente’s federalist proposals. The president has received some rather irate and threatening letters over his plans, but these crude attempts at intimidation have not dissuaded him. He knows that federalism is necessary for Colombia to be more than just a republican New Spain. Colombia will never develop a national identity unless it is one nation, and it will never be one nation if it leans too far either towards ruthless centralization or slothful decentralization. As Vicente continues his work, this time on a letter to the Caudillo of Andagoya about tariffs, he hears a noise at the door. Strange, he thinks to himself - everyone else in the presidential palace ought to be asleep by now. Heading to the door, he opens it to find…"

 dvg_gran_colombia.15.d:0 "The Death of Vicente"
 dvg_gran_colombia.15.f:0 "Rumors of the President’s assassination spread through Mexico City like a wildfire, but only this morning was it confirmed, in a somber announcement by Vice President Benito Villa. The murder of the Father of the Nation has caused Mexico City to descend into chaos. As Vicente had not yet formalized the method of presidential succession, the uncharismatic Villa has been all but forgotten as multiple politicians and officers have declared themselves acting president of Colombia. Street brawls have erupted into shootouts, as neighborhoods become battlegrounds. Two sides have emerged : the centralists, who see Vicente’s death as proof that a strong hand is needed to rule Colombia, and the radical federalists, who are prepared to take decentralization to its limits if it means preventing more violence in the future. As the blood flows through the streets of the cradle of south Arcadian liberty, it is unclear whether this is Colombia’s crucible or its requiem."

 dvg_gran_colombia.16.d:0 "The Plan of Toluca"
 dvg_gran_colombia.16.f:0 "Amidst the carnage of Mexico City following President Vicente’s death, Lusitanian General Deodoro Peixoto managed to secure control of the Mexico City countryside. Backed by the rural landowners, Peixoto and his supporters gathered in Toluca and proclaimed the Plan of Toluca. In it, Peixoto has declared the Colombian experiment to be a failure! Citing the “irreconcilable” differences between its various regions and cultures, Peixoto seeks to allow Colombia’s constituent parts to go their own way. With overwhelming support from various caudillos, he fought his way back into the capital and quelled the unrest, being sworn in as President shortly thereafter. Soon, the Colombian legislature shall hold a vote to abolish the Alliance, and then Colombia’s major provincial caudillos will meet in Oaxaca City in two weeks to officially dissolve it."

 dvg_gran_colombia.17.d:0 "The Oaxaca Protocol"
 dvg_gran_colombia.17.f:0 "Tensions in Colombia exploded in the aftermath of President Vicente’s assassination. No figure has yet emerged who could unify the confederation with the charisma and diplomacy of Vicente, or who commands as much respect as he did. Bowing to what radical federalists see as the inevitable, the Colombian legislature passed a bill voting the nation out of existence, and now the caudillos of Colombia’s various provinces have convened in Oaxaca City to dissolve the confederation. President Peixoto opened the event with a short but poignant speech reiterating the need for dissolution, arguing that Colombia as a single nation-state will inevitably become repressive and that each nationality must obtain liberty. However, there are whispers that Lieutenant Colonel Ernesto Castro, popular centralist icon, escaped the Mexico City anarchy and has been preparing to stage a coup in a desperate bid to avert the confederation’s dissolution. What shall be the fate of Colombia?"

 dvg_gran_colombia.18.f:0 "Amidst the carnage of Mexico City following President Vicente’s death, Lieutenant Colonel Castro took control of the vital port city of Veracruz while order in the rest of the country began to collapse. A dashing young Cuban, he proved a skilled tactician during the First Colombian War of Independence, repeatedly outfoxing the Spanish with clever and innovative maneuvers, and rose meteorically through the ranks. He achieved true fame when he liberated Veracruz and then fended off three separate Spanish attempts to reconquer it. Now, in the city which won him his fame, Castro has rallied the military and the centralists to his side with the Plan of Veracruz, announcing his intention to establish a strong central government and curtail radicalism. Even some rural elites have supported him, possibly believing that he will prove a pawn if successful. With most of the military now loyal to him, he has fallen like a thunderbolt upon Mexico City, and soon enough he shall be sworn in as the new President."

 dvg_gran_colombia.19.f:0 "After Castro was sworn into office, he gave a speech to the assembled crowd, outlining his goals and intentions going forward. “Colombia is destined to be a colossus of the New World,” he declared, “but only if we give her the sword and the shield which she needs.” Castro went on to explain that this meant a strong, centralized government, an orderly political sphere, and a bold foreign policy “unafraid to make adventurous choices in the interest of liberation.” He confidently predicted that Colombia will be “the true seat of power in the New World.” Castro wound up his remarks by stating that he was “prepared to bring a new, visionary strength to the Colombian executive, the likes of which few have seen before, or even dreamt of.” Centralists and expansionists were thrilled by his rhetoric, but many others - especially rural elites - were concerned by his implications. If Castro does not make Colombia a world power, then there may be consequences."

 dvg_gran_colombia.20.f:0 "As Castro continues to reshape domestic politics, he has taken an interest in foreign affairs as well. Specifically, he has set his sights upon Cuba, and has initiated a media campaign to promote the Colombian government’s claim to the island. Castro has stressed Cuba’s “ethnic and political kinship” with Colombia, its “indisputable destiny” to “be united” with Colombia, and the “urgent necessity” of “admitting” Cuba into “our grand nation.” The Cuban authorities have taken this news poorly, and Castro’s bellicose remarks have been criticized both by Cuban conservatives, who are largely sympathetic to the Spanish crown and fearful of Colombian radicalism, and Cuban liberals, many of whom demand a free and sovereign Cuba. Nevertheless, Castro has committed vast political resources to acquiring Cuba. If Castro cannot fulfill his assertions, then there may be consequences."

Long live Colombia, long live independence!” – Last words of Ernesto Castro\n\nIn the chaos following Vicente’s death, Colombians saw Ernesto Castro as the man who could raise Colombia to greatness, but Castro has failed to fulfill his lofty promises. The caudillos have been disillusioned by his callous centralization, and they have sought another savior. They found General Agustín de Santander, an ambitious and charismatic officer of noble blood and with many elite connections. Santander issued the Plan of Colima, promising to end centralization and respect Colombia’s regional differences, and rallied public support against Castro. Quickly marching on Mexico City, Castro was deposed after a brief battle, before being tried, convicted, and executed for treason. Once more, the presidency of Colombia has been claimed through bloodshed."

 dvg_gran_colombia.22.f:0 "Castro’s overthrow by a liberal revolution was supposed to usher in a new era of enlightened, scientific governance. Yet this concept terrified caudillos across the nation, who stood to lose much from the liberal disdain for traditional networks of power. To preserve their influence, they have rallied behind General Agustín de Santander, a man of noble blood and charismatic personality. Santander recently issued the “Plan of Colima,” denouncing the liberals as heartless thieves, promising to respect Colombia’s regional differences, and exhorting the Colombian people to stand up for their traditions and institutions. Flush with caudillo money, Santander then swooped down on Mexico City with an army of followers, casting out the liberals and claiming the Colombian presidency for himself. With Castro’s wife taking his infant son into exile in the Dual Monarchy, both liberalism and Castroism lie defeated, and the age of Santander has begun."

 dvg_gran_colombia.23.f:0 "Emperor Ernesto created a strong, centralized government, a powerful nation free from caudillismo : for him to take up a crown in the aftermath was only natural. Some, however, disagreed, despising Ernesto for violating their notions of Colombian republicanism. Now these traitors have committed the vilest crime. As the Emperor was heading through downtown Mexico City on his return from a diplomatic visit to the Dual Monarchy, an assassin leapt from the crowd and fired upon him! Both he and his wife, Empress Eva, were pronounced dead at the hospital. The assassin, quickly apprehended by the gendarmes, was identified as Emilio Cardenas, an anarchist with ties to republican groups. The regicide has horrified Colombians yet has not ignited revolts. While many republicans are now trying to press for radical political change, it seems that the rule of the House de Castro has been accepted, the popularity of the new Emperor Ernesto II – and the regency which shall rule until he is no longer a child - sealed by the martyrdom of his father."

 dvg_gran_colombia.23.f:0 "The assassination of Emperor Ernesto may not have incited a civil war, but the political situation is nevertheless perilous. Many republicans resigned themselves to quieter means of political struggle while Ernesto the First was alive, but news of his death threatened to give his enemies the chance to tear down the institutions which he built. The landlords and caudillos certainly had no special attraction to the man they saw as the reason for their decline. Thus, to prevent the republicans from deposing the regency, the monarchists have been forced to make massive concessions to their political rivals for the sake of national unity. The “Golden Constitution,” as liberals have called it, extends tremendous political rights, including universal suffrage and a free press, while also federalizing the government. Ernesto the First would be turning in his grave if he knew what the regency council has done but at least the empire which he built will survive him."

 dvg_gran_colombia.24.f:0 "President Vicente has announced his boldest plan yet : the creation of a Colombian constitution to transform the nation into a united, democratic, parliamentary republic. The document lays out protections for the rights of the people, and clarifies the roles, powers, and responsibilities of the national government. While Vicente has taken care to delineate the boundaries of federal authority and reserve numerous rights and duties to the provinces, the document has already drawn strong criticism from provincial caudillos as a dictum handed down from above rather than the result of popular debate. The president is counting on his status as a national hero, and the courting of liberal sentiments, to ensure the constitution’s ratification, and drafts are already being delivered to the Colombian state governments."

Many of them have now gathered in Morelia, where they have drafted a document to explain their objections to Vicente and his supporters. The manifesto claims that the constitution as written concentrates an unacceptable amount of power into the hands of the federal government, opening the door for any of Vicente’s successors to use it to strangle the provinces. Moreover, they have criticized the process of the constitution’s promulgation, objecting to having been left out of the creative process. While the manifesto reaffirms the caudillos’ loyalty to Colombia and its president, denouncing anyone who attempts to use their criticism as grounds for secession, the manifesto’s conclusion declares that “All who sign this document in doing so declare their intent to withhold their signature from the new constitution in its present form.” Most of Colombia’s caudillos have signed it…"
