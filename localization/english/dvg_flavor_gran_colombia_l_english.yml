 dvg_gran_colombia.1.t:0 "The Calm before the Storm"
 dvg_gran_colombia.1.d:0 "The Colombian Alliance!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.1.f:0 "For centuries, Spain has ruled its colonies with the greed and heartlessness of an absentee landlord. The liberal King Jose II usurped the Spanish throne in 1808 and seemed willing to increase colonial trade and local elites’ power, but the Dual Monarchy backed the absolutist pretender Pedro III against Jose. After taking the throne in 1815 at the end of the brutal Peninsular War, Pedro issued the Petrine “Reforms.” The Reforms strangled domestic colonial trade and confirmed the status of European-born peninsulares as the colonial elite despite calls for local representation. The crushing of the revolutionary First Mexican Republic by Spain in 1817 lit the flame of independence throughout Spain’s colonies, who formed the Colombian Alliance, led by liberal Anastasio Vicente, to win their freedom. We are currently observing an armistice with Spain, but war may soon return. Some whisper of fractures within the Alliance, but so long as the Spanish crown still seeks to destroy us, we must unite for the sake of liberty!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.1.a:0 ""Independence!" shouts the New World : The land of Columbus is bathed in heroes' blood!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.2.t:0 "The Colombian War for Independence"
 dvg_gran_colombia.2.d:0 "The Revolutionary State Marches to War"
 dvg_gran_colombia.2.f:0 "The Independence of New Toledo has sent ripples throughout Arcadia and Ameriga, and these ripples have finally reached Mexico City. The Colombian Alliance wants independence from the Spanish Crown and has been granted support from their New Toledo peers, leaving New Granada as the sole remaining loyal Viceroyalty in the New World. We must bring freedom to Colombia, and if God wills it, to Granada as well."
 dvg_gran_colombia.2.a:0 "Grã-Colômbia shall prevail!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.3.t:0 "Success in the Independence War"
 dvg_gran_colombia.3.d:0 "A Glorious Day!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.3.f:0 "With the help of New Toledo, we have driven off the Spanish from Colombia! It will take some time to rebuild the ruined cities and villages, but Colombian Caudilho Vicente is certain it can only go better from here."
 dvg_gran_colombia.3.a:0 "Celebrate!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.4.t:0 "The Independence War Meets with Failure"
 dvg_gran_colombia.4.d:0 "La Muerte..."
 dvg_gran_colombia.4.f:0 "With the failure of the combined forces of Grã-Colômbia and New Toledo to beat the Spanish, the Colombian Alliance is dissolved and the Viceroyalty is reinstated. Rumours abound of a new era of Spanish dominance over not only Ameriga, but Arcadia as well..."
 dvg_gran_colombia.4.a:0 "Alas..."
 dvg_gran_colombia.5.t:0 "The Spanish Want a Truce"
 dvg_gran_colombia.5.d:0 "The Spanish decide to withdraw from Colombia..."
 dvg_gran_colombia.5.f:0 "With the war being waged for so long, the Spanish have decided to abandon the former Viceroyalty of New Spain. Grã-Colômbia shall now be free to decide its fate on the world stage."
 dvg_gran_colombia.5.a:0 "A victory nonetheless."
 dvg_gran_colombia.6.t:0 "The Colombian Navy"
 dvg_gran_colombia.6.d:0 "Grand Opening of the Colombian Navy"
 dvg_gran_colombia.6.f:0 "Wonderful news, my caudilho! We have recently finished with our project to build up a proper Colombian navy. During the Colombian War of Independence, we couldn't reach Kuba due to lack of navy against the Spanish Armada despite the Cuban's contribution to the revolution. With our newly created navy, hopefully we can reunite with our Cuban compatriots against Spanish imperialism once again."
 dvg_gran_colombia.6.a:0 "One step closer to Cuba!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.7.t:0 "Cuban Affair"
 dvg_gran_colombia.7.d:0 "The Conquest of Cuba"
 dvg_gran_colombia.7.f:0 "Great news! We have recently liberated Kuba from the Spanish once and for all. During the Colombian War of Independence, we couldn't reach Kuba due to lack of navy against the Spanish Armada despite the Cuban's contribution to the revolution. Since the Spanish are distracted by nationalist problems at home, we managed to liberate Kuba from their grasp, ending centuries of Spanish rule on the island."
 dvg_gran_colombia.7.a:0 "At last, the remnant of Spanish colonialism has returned to Colombia!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.8.t:0 "Granadan Affair"
 dvg_gran_colombia.8.d:0 "The Conquest of Granada"
 dvg_gran_colombia.8.f:0 "More news, my caudilho! After months of campaigning, we have recently conquered Granada. During the Colombian War of Independence, Granada was once a Spanish loyalist stronghold, but with the Spanish withdrawal, Granada remains no match to our might once we marched down to Medellín. Despite our liberation, we are currently facing resistance in Granada and we must quell it down before we could advance to our next target."
 dvg_gran_colombia.8.a:0 "Granada is ours!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.9.t:0 "The Pacification of Granada"
 dvg_gran_colombia.9.d:0 "Pacifying Granada"
 dvg_gran_colombia.9.f:0 "Despite the difficulties that we faced so far, we have recently pacified Granada for good. The Granadan resistance has cited nationalist reasons such as cultural and language differences between the Colombian and the Granadan, and that they wish to remain independent from Colombia. Luckily, our persuasion campaign to the Granadan populace has paid off with many Granadans agreed to join our cause for a greater Colombia."
 dvg_gran_colombia.9.a:0 "Colombia grows larger everyday!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.10.t:0 "New Toledan Affair"
 dvg_gran_colombia.10.d:0 "The Conquest of New Toledo"
 dvg_gran_colombia.10.f:0 "Even more wonderful news! We have recently finished our liberation of New Toledo. Despite the New Toledans' contribution to our liberation of Granada from Spanish rule, they have remained hesitant with joining Colombia. Since our liberation, we have began sending officials to convince the New Toledans on supporting to unification of Colombia and New Toledo."
 dvg_gran_colombia.10.a:0 "At last, the total reunification from Colombia to New Toledo!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.11.t:0 "Foreign Policy"
 dvg_gran_colombia.11.d:0 "Military Policy"
 dvg_gran_colombia.11.f:0 "Since Spain no longer controls continental Ameriga and Arcardia, let us focus on our military relation with Granada and New Toledo. One option is a full military alliance between the three nations. Another option is to form a defensive pact between the three nations. The last option would be to keep relation at arm's length to avoid any complications when either Granada or New Toledo is at war."
 dvg_gran_colombia.11.a:0 "Let us cement the Colombian alliance!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.11.b:0 "Let us keep it as a defensive pact."
 dvg_gran_colombia.11.c:0 "It is best to keep the relation at arm's length."
 dvg_gran_colombia.12.t:0 "Foreign Policy"
 dvg_gran_colombia.12.d:0 "Trade Policy"
 dvg_gran_colombia.12.f:0 "Since we are done with the military policy, let us focus on trade policy. Considering that all three nations are underdeveloped currently, one proposal would be to establish a custom union so all three nations can have access to each other's market. Another option is to establish trade agreements between the three nations to allow reduced tariffs for trade goods while ensuring that the three nations' markets remain independent. The third option is to do neither as the Colombian market would not benefit from either deals."
 dvg_gran_colombia.12.a:0 "Let us form a custom union!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.12.b:0 "A trade agreement would suffice."
 dvg_gran_colombia.12.c:0 "On second thought, maybe this is not necessary."
