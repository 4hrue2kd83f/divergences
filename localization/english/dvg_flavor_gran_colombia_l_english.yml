 dvg_gran_colombia.1.d:0 "The Colombian Alliance!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.1.f:0 "For centuries, Spain has ruled its colonies with the greed and heartlessness of an absentee landlord. The liberal King Jose II usurped the Spanish throne in 1808 and seemed willing to increase colonial trade and local elites’ power, but the Dual Monarchy backed the absolutist pretender Pedro III against Jose. After taking the throne in 1815 at the end of the brutal Peninsular War, Pedro issued the Petrine “Reforms.” The Reforms strangled domestic colonial trade and confirmed the status of European-born peninsulares as the colonial elite despite calls for local representation. The crushing of the revolutionary First Mexican Republic by Spain in 1817 lit the flame of independence throughout Spain’s colonies, who formed the Colombian Alliance, led by liberal Anastasio Vicente, to win their freedom. We are currently observing an armistice with Spain, but war may soon return. Some whisper of fractures within the Alliance, but so long as the Spanish crown still seeks to destroy us, we must unite for the sake of liberty!"

 # dvg_gran_colombia.6.f:0 "Guillermo de Blanco has finally emerged from hiding and led his guerillas into Bogota, capping off a period of raiding and recruitment that has seen his band of followers swell into a true revolutionary army. He has now declared the Republic of Herreria, named after the “Father of the Revolution,” José de Herrera, and is engaged in a fight for the fate of New Granada against the Spanish. As we share his animosity towards Spain, de Blanco has petitioned us to aid him, and to join forces against the Spanish Crown. If he is successful, then perhaps we could leverage this into Herreria joining the Colombian Alliance, finally securing the massive, revolutionary New World state of de Herrera’s dreams. Of course, more pessimistic, cynical ministers see de Blanco as a power-mad brute, infamous for his hatred of the Incas and more likely to be a liability than an ally. Still, surely a free Herreria is preferable to a hostile New Granada?"

The aim of this proclamation is to make clear the necessity of restoring honor to the nation…” – General Agustín de Santander\n\nThe failure of the Colombian government to support the Herrerian Revolution and the collapse of the radical cause in New Granada has spurred dissent against the Vicente regime. A conservative general named Agustín de Santander took advantage of Vicente being confined to his bed with a fever, and led a military contingent into Mexico City, declaring himself the new President of Colombia. With the opposition paralyzed, it seems that Santander’s reign has already begun."

Considering that all three nations are underdeveloped currently, one proposal would be to establish a custom union so all three nations can have access to each other's market. Another option is to establish trade agreements between the three nations to allow reduced tariffs for trade goods while ensuring that the three nations' markets remain independent. The third option is to do neither as the Colombian market would not benefit from either deals."

 dvg_gran_colombia.15.f:0 "President Anastasio Vicente has been under an unusual amount of stress lately. Rural landowners and provincial caudillos are beginning to express opposition to any reform of the current, massively decentralized system, alarmed by Vicente’s federalist proposals. The president has received some rather irate and threatening letters over his plans, but these crude attempts at intimidation have not dissuaded him. He knows that federalism is necessary for Colombia to be more than just a republican New Spain. Colombia will never develop a national identity unless it is one nation, and it will never be one nation if it leans too far either towards ruthless centralization or slothful decentralization. As Vicente continues his work, this time on a letter to the Caudillo of Andagoya about tariffs, he hears a noise at the door. Strange, he thinks to himself - everyone else in the presidential palace ought to be asleep by now. Heading to the door, he opens it to find…"

 dvg_gran_colombia.16.f:0 "Rumors of the President’s assassination spread through Mexico City like a wildfire, but only this morning was it confirmed, in a somber announcement by Vice President Benito Villa. The murder of the Father of the Nation has caused Mexico City to descend into chaos. As Vicente had not yet formalized the method of presidential succession, the uncharismatic Villa has been all but forgotten as multiple politicians and officers have declared themselves acting president of Colombia. Street brawls have erupted into shootouts, as neighborhoods become battlegrounds. Two sides have emerged : the centralists, who see Vicente’s death as proof that a strong hand is needed to rule Colombia, and the radical federalists, who are prepared to take decentralization to its limits if it means preventing more violence in the future. As the blood flows through the streets of the cradle of south Arcadian liberty, it is unclear whether this is Colombia’s crucible or its requiem."

Backed by the rural landowners, Peixoto and his supporters gathered in Toluca and proclaimed the Plan of Toluca. In it, Peixoto has declared the Colombian experiment to be a failure! Citing the “irreconcilable” differences between its various regions and cultures, Peixoto seeks to allow Colombia’s constituent parts to go their own way. With overwhelming support from various caudillos, he fought his way back into the capital and quelled the unrest, being sworn in as President shortly thereafter. Soon, the Colombian legislature shall hold a vote to abolish the Alliance, and then Colombia’s major provincial caudillos will meet in Oaxaca City in two weeks to officially dissolve it."

No figure has yet emerged who could unify the confederation with the charisma and diplomacy of Vicente, or who commands as much respect as he did. Bowing to what radical federalists see as the inevitable, the Colombian legislature passed a bill voting the nation out of existence, and now the caudillos of Colombia’s various provinces have convened in Oaxaca City to dissolve the confederation. President Peixoto opened the event with a short but poignant speech reiterating the need for dissolution, arguing that Colombia as a single nation-state will inevitably become repressive and that each nationality must obtain liberty. However, there are whispers that Lieutenant Colonel Ernesto Castro, popular centralist icon, escaped the Mexico City anarchy and has been preparing to stage a coup in a desperate bid to avert the confederation’s dissolution.

A dashing young Cuban, he proved a skilled tactician during the First Colombian War of Independence, repeatedly outfoxing the Spanish with clever and innovative maneuvers, and rose meteorically through the ranks. He achieved true fame when he liberated Veracruz and then fended off three separate Spanish attempts to reconquer it. Now, in the city which won him his fame, Castro has rallied the military and the centralists to his side with the Plan of Veracruz, announcing his intention to establish a strong central government and curtail radicalism. Even some rural elites have supported him, possibly believing that he will prove a pawn if successful. With most of the military now loyal to him, he has fallen like a thunderbolt upon Mexico City, and soon enough he shall be sworn in as the new President."

Specifically, he has set his sights upon Cuba, and has initiated a media campaign to promote the Colombian government’s claim to the island. Castro has stressed Cuba’s “ethnic and political kinship” with Colombia, its “indisputable destiny” to “be united” with Colombia, and the “urgent necessity” of “admitting” Cuba into “our grand nation.” The Cuban authorities have taken this news poorly, and Castro’s bellicose remarks have been criticized both by Cuban conservatives, who are largely sympathetic to the Spanish crown and fearful of Colombian radicalism, and Cuban liberals, many of whom demand a free and sovereign Cuba. Nevertheless, Castro has committed vast political resources to acquiring Cuba. If Castro cannot fulfill his assertions, then there may be consequences."

Long live Colombia, long live independence!” – Last words of Ernesto Castro\n\nIn the chaos following Vicente’s death, Colombians saw Ernesto Castro as the man who could raise Colombia to greatness, but Castro has failed to fulfill his lofty promises. The caudillos have been disillusioned by his callous centralization, and they have sought another savior. They found General Agustín de Santander, an ambitious and charismatic officer of noble blood and with many elite connections. Santander issued the Plan of Colima, promising to end centralization and respect Colombia’s regional differences, and rallied public support against Castro. Quickly marching on Mexico City, Castro was deposed after a brief battle, before being tried, convicted, and executed for treason. Once more, the presidency of Colombia has been claimed through bloodshed."

Yet this concept terrified caudillos across the nation, who stood to lose much from the liberal disdain for traditional networks of power. To preserve their influence, they have rallied behind General Agustín de Santander, a man of noble blood and charismatic personality. Santander recently issued the “Plan of Colima,” denouncing the liberals as heartless thieves, promising to respect Colombia’s regional differences, and exhorting the Colombian people to stand up for their traditions and institutions. Flush with caudillo money, Santander then swooped down on Mexico City with an army of followers, casting out the liberals and claiming the Colombian presidency for himself. With Castro’s wife taking his infant son into exile in the Dual Monarchy, both liberalism and Castroism lie defeated, and the age of Santander has begun."

Some, however, disagreed, despising Ernesto for violating their notions of Colombian republicanism. Now these traitors have committed the vilest crime. As the Emperor was heading through downtown Mexico City on his return from a diplomatic visit to the Dual Monarchy, an assassin leapt from the crowd and fired upon him! Both he and his wife, Empress Eva, were pronounced dead at the hospital. The assassin, quickly apprehended by the gendarmes, was identified as Emilio Cardenas, an anarchist with ties to republican groups. The regicide has horrified Colombians yet has not ignited revolts. While many republicans are now trying to press for radical political change, it seems that the rule of the House de Castro has been accepted, the popularity of the new Emperor Ernesto II – and the regency which shall rule until he is no longer a child - sealed by the martyrdom of his father."

Many republicans resigned themselves to quieter means of political struggle while Ernesto the First was alive, but news of his death threatened to give his enemies the chance to tear down the institutions which he built. The landlords and caudillos certainly had no special attraction to the man they saw as the reason for their decline. Thus, to prevent the republicans from deposing the regency, the monarchists have been forced to make massive concessions to their political rivals for the sake of national unity. The “Golden Constitution,” as liberals have called it, extends tremendous political rights, including universal suffrage and a free press, while also federalizing the government.

Moreover, they have criticized the process of the constitution’s promulgation, objecting to having been left out of the creative process. While the manifesto reaffirms the caudillos’ loyalty to Colombia and its president, denouncing anyone who attempts to use their criticism as grounds for secession, the manifesto’s conclusion declares that “All who sign this document in doing so declare their intent to withhold their signature from the new constitution in its present form.” Most of Colombia’s caudillos have signed it…"

Many conservatives, however, feel that such topics are inappropriate for this conference, and the caudillos are intensely wary of language setting down immigration as something which only the federal government, not individual state governments, can control.

Such a concept strikes at the very heart of aristocratic and stratocratic privilege which supports many provincial caudillos and is anathema to the traditionalist officer corps of the Colombian military. Moderates have proposed a minimal program of basic training for all adult Colombian males, but even this may be too much for the conservatives to stomach.

 dvg_gran_colombia.32.f:0 "After tense and extensive debate between liberals and conservatives, President Vicente and the provincial caudillos have finally arrived at a compromise and drafted a new Colombian constitution. Though highly conservative in some respects, the final document upholds Vicente’s principles of democratic, representative federalism. Furthermore, the conference has established a positive precedent for the peaceful resolution of Colombia’s political disputes via debate and collaboration, not intrigue and warfare. All eyes are now on Vicente, to see if he will be able to prove the constitution’s worth by elevating Colombia to new heights of greatness. If he cannot do so even with the document which he and his supporters worked so hard to achieve, then the luster may fade from his achievement and the wolves may once again lurk at the door."

 dvg_gran_colombia.33.f:0 "The Veracruz Conference, rather than find a compromise between President Vicente and his critics, instead saw the liberals attempt to force upon the conservatives a document which they had no interest in supporting. When news of this leaked out, General Agustín de Santander, a man known for his aristocratic background and his strong ties to various Colombian landlords, declared the conference illegal and attempted to arrest Vicente and his liberal supporters! While many reformists were seized by Santander’s rebels, a few managed to smuggle Vicente out of Veracruz and back to Mexico City. As the constitutional draft languishes forgotten, the future of Colombia hangs in the balance."

 dvg_gran_colombia.34.f:0 "Santander soon realized that he’d been tricked : with no sign of Vicente within Veracruz, he raced to Mexico City and will soon be at its gates. In the middle of the night, with Santander and his forces expected to arrive the next morning, Vicente is called upon by two mysterious men. After his guards search them and Vicente receives them in his office, they reveal themselves : Deodoro Peixoto and Puente de Marquez, the two most powerful caudillos in Colombia. They explain that they have come as representatives of Colombia’s caudillos, who do not trust Santander and fear that he may become a tyrant in ways which Vicente has never been. Therefore, they are willing to throw their forces to Vicente’s defense and shatter Santander’s coup attempt, but their price is steep. Peixoto and de Marquez demand nothing less than total autonomy for their states in return for their aid, and warn that if Vicente refuses, they will swallow their pride and back Santander to prevent liberal domination. What happened next is well recorded…"
