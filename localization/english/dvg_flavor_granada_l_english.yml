 dvg_granada.1.t:0 "The Colombian Independence War and the Viceroyalty of New Granada"
 dvg_granada.1.d:0 "Treachery!"
 dvg_granada.1.f:0 "The Independence of New Toledo has sent ripples throughout Arcadia and Ameriga, and these ripples have finally reached Mexico City. This so-called Colombian Alliance wants independence from the Spanish Crown and has been granted support from their New Toledo peers, leaving New Granada as the sole remaining loyal Viceroyalty in the New World. We must drive back these upstarts and restore the Crown's control over New Spain, lest the revolutionary fervor spreads to our Viceroyalty as well."
 dvg_granada.1.a:0 "For New Granada! For Spain!"
 dvg_granada.2.t:0 "The Colombian Alliance is Defeated"
 dvg_granada.2.d:0 "The revolt in New Spain has been quelled, and the Crown's sovereignity over Mesoameriga is secured."
 dvg_granada.2.f:0 "Victory! In the ruined countryside and cities of New Spain, the might of the Spanish has never been seen more than now. The Alliance loyalists have been routed and Mexico City once again belongs to the Spanish Viceroy. It will take some time before cities and villages of New Spain are restored to their former glory, but now it's clear that Spain is there to stay, and we shall stand with them as we always did."
 dvg_granada.2.a:0 "We stand with Spain!"
 dvg_granada.3.t:0 "The Colombian Independence"
 dvg_granada.3.d:0 "We have failed. The Viceroyalty of New Spain is no more."
 dvg_granada.3.f:0 "The Colombian Independence War is over, and the Spanish forces retreat back to New Granada. Despite our loyalty to the Crown, the Colombian revolt has inspired many people within New Granada, and these voices have only grown louder with the Colombian Alliance's success. New movements are taking form, with the republicans and royalists alike asking for self-governance and independence from Madrid. The time to act is now, lest we too are embroiled in a fratricidal war."
 dvg_granada.3.a:0 "We shall join the Colombians and drive out the Spanish forevermore."
 dvg_granada.3.b:0 "We shall stand loyal to Spain in exchange for greater autonomy. At least for now."
 dvg_granada.4.t:0 "The Truce of 1838"
 dvg_granada.4.d:0 "Stalemate. The Colombian Alliance has seceded, but New Granada is secure."
 dvg_granada.4.f:0 "The Colombian Independence War is over, and the Spanish forces retreat back to New Granada. Despite our loyalty to the Crown, the Colombian revolt has inspired many people within New Granada, and these voices have only grown louder with the Colombian Alliance's success.

 dvg_granada.5.t:0 "The Herrera Revolution"
 dvg_granada.5.d:0 "Treason! General de Blanco has proclaimed the Republic of Herreria and seceded from Granada!"
 dvg_granada.5.f:0 "With the acquisition of Medellin, de Blanco is now prepared to fully contest Spanish rule of New Granada. In a speech delivered from Viceroy Rocafuerte's former mansion, de Blanco has declared himself the “Great Liberator” of a new revolutionary nation, the Republic of Herreria! The insurrectionary state is named after infamous New Granadan revolutionary José de Herrera, who fought both the Incans and the Spanish crown before being killed by Washkar Inca. It seems that de Blanco thinks himself a second de Herrera, and with much of western New Granada now aligned towards him, he might just be able to back up his claims. Rocafuerte’s intrigues have been unable to topple the Viceroyalty of New Granada in time, but if de Blanco is successful then he too shall surely triumph. As northern Ameriga plunges back into the inferno, we must once again prepare for a bitter struggle in the New World."
 dvg_granada.5.a:0 "Revolution is a malaise of New World minds..."
 dvg_granada.5.b:0 "The freedom of the New World is the hope of the universe! (Play as Herreria)"
 dvg_granada.5.c:0 "Enjoy your so-called revolutionary state, madman."
 dvg_granada.5.d:0 "Long live Herreria! Long live de Blanco! (Play as Herreria)"
 dvg_granada.6.t:0 "The Dream is Dead"
 dvg_granada.6.d:0 "The warlords of Granada carve out their domains and the dream of united Granada is no more."
 dvg_granada.6.f:0 "With de Blanco's revolutionaries firmly in control of Herreria, Antonio Rocafuerte makes his move and proclaims the Kingdom of Aureliana in Caracas, followed by Guianan separatists in Essequibo. Where once New Granada stood, three new powers have emerged, each with different views on the fate of what was once the Viceroyalty. Despite their best efforts to drive out the Spanish, they could not save the dream of united Granada."
 dvg_granada.6.a:0 "The end of an era, or merely the start of one? (Play as Aureliana)"
 dvg_granada.6.b:0 "At least we may celebrate this victory. (Play as Essequibo)"
 dvg_granada.7.t:0 "The Raid on the Caracas Armory"
 dvg_granada.7.d:0 "De Blanco's revolutionaries strike at Caracas!"
 dvg_granada.7.f:0 "We thought that the end of the struggle with Colombia would inaugurate a new era of stability in the rest of our empire, but this seems to have been too optimistic. This morning, word reached the royal court that the Spanish Army’s Caracas armory was looted by the guerilla forces of notorious revolutionary Guillermo de Blanco! Apparently, Ramon Salgar, a llanero (cowboy) warlord who is de Blanco’s right-hand man and a native of Aureliana, used a little-known mountain path to bypass the local patrols, then assaulted the town shortly after midnight. His feared Legion of Hell overpowered the initial defenses and headed straight for the armory, blowing open the doors and grabbing all the arms and ammunition that they could carry. As they absconded back into the wilderness, they shouted horrid curses towards the Spanish crown, and cried, “Viva Salgar! Viva de Blanco!” De Blanco’s traitors are now quite well-armed."
 dvg_granada.7.a:0 "Bring me the head of Guillermo de Blanco!"
 dvg_granada.8.t:0 "Raids in Cartagena Countryside"
 dvg_granada.8.d:0 "De Blanco's revolutionaries strike at Cartagena!"
 dvg_granada.8.f:0 "De Blanco wasted no time in putting his ill-gotten gains to use. He has returned to a more confrontational posture, launching coordinated assaults upon loyalist communities throughout the greater Cartagena region. Guerillas have attacked villages across the area, pilfering everything from crops and livestock to tools and medicine. Any town which does not sufficiently “support” de Blanco’s cause is a potential target. As the guerillas wage their most ambitious campaign of violence yet, de Blanco is slowly but surely approaching Medellin, local administrative center of New Granada. If Medellin falls, the whole Spanish colonial government may be imperiled."
 dvg_granada.8.a:0 "Medellin must not fall!"
 dvg_granada.9.t:0 "Essequibo Declares Independence!"
 dvg_granada.9.d:0 "New Granada's eastern flank, Essequibo has proclaimed independence!"

 dvg_granada.9.a:0 "We can't spare the resources, let them have it."
