 dvg_guliconfed.1.t:0 "The Guli Confederation as it stands"
 dvg_guliconfed.1.d:0 "Our Guli Confederation, originally known as the 'Koori', we are a loose confederation of many tribes spanning from the Yongding river all the way to the outskirts of Shahu! However, our control over Yongling is negligible, with the only idea of a 'Guli Nation' existing in a pitiful village designated as our capital by the authorites in Yaluo..."
 dvg_guliconfed.1.f:0 "It's clear to our government that a lot of work lays ahead of us, with the path forwards unclear; shall we remain loyal to Qingshui? Will we ever realise the idea of a 'Guli Identity"? How will we adapt to the changing world around us? Questions that can only be answered by taking steps forwards towards a fate unkown."
 dvg_guliconfed.1.a:0 "We have an uncertain future, to be sure."
