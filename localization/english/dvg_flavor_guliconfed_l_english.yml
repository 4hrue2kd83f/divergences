 je_found_yushan:0 "Found Yushan"
 je_found_yushan_reason:0 "Yushan - as it has been designated by the Yaluo - is to be the site for the Guli capital. As of now our seat of government is located in Qingshui, it is imperative that we establish Yushan and relocate our seat of government there to begin effectively managing our country!"
 je_guli_language:0 "Language of the People"
 je_guli_language_reason:0 "The ambitions of the confederation can only be reached by one unified language, as we look to the Yaluo education model to design our own, it has become increasingly clear that the Guli people must speak one language, both to cement our state as a nation and for one unified Guli Identity."
 je_yaluo_approval:0 "Yaluo Approval"
 je_yaluo_approval_reason:0 "Whilst we forge our own path, we still have the Yaluo watching over us, whilst we want our own identity, the Yaluo would rather see us remaining under Qingshui's gaze. We must tread carefully whilst we foster our young confederation, or prepare for the Yaluo to take direct rule from Qingshui..."
 je_guli_identity:0 "The Guli Identity"
 je_guli_identity_desc:0 "To create a functioning confederation, we must create a unified Guli identity. The drastic diversity of each tribe makes it difficult for us to give us a sense of nationhood and stand on our own. Taking aspects of Yaluo culture and our own various Hongshan identities will finally allow our people to call themselves Guli!"
 
 #Events
 dvg_guliconfed.1.t:0 "The Guli Confederation as it stands"
 dvg_guliconfed.1.d:0 "Our Guli Confederation, we are a loose confederation of many tribes spanning from the Yongding river all the way to the outskirts of Shahu! However, our control over Yongling is negligible, with the only idea of a 'Guli Nation' existing in a pitiful village designated as our capital by the authorites in Yaluo..."
 dvg_guliconfed.1.f:0 "It's clear to our government that a lot of work lays ahead of us, with the path forwards unclear; shall we remain loyal to Qingshui? Will we ever realise the idea of a 'Guli Identity"? How will we adapt to the changing world around us? Questions that can only be answered by taking steps forwards towards a fate unkown."
 dvg_guliconfed.1.a:0 "We have an uncertain future, to be sure."
 dvg_guliconfed.2.t:0 "Yushan is established!"
 dvg_guliconfed.2.d:0 "As the rest of our bureaucrats make the long journey from Qingshu to Yushan, we can finally take the time to celebrate and rest easy in the new Guli Government House in the centre of Yushan"
 dvg_guliconfed.2.f:0 "Opponents of the Guli Confederation would often accuse us of being a false state, "For one with a government outside their borders is not a state, but a subdivision unrealised!". However now we can finally show them otherwise, our modern offices and only the finest - and most sensible - furnishings for new seat of government, will surely convince any nay-sayers of our legitemacy. Yet now is no time to convince the world of our nationhood, there are more important internal matters to attend to..."
 dvg_guliconfed.2.a:0 ""Fine, fine... let them throw untrue accusations around if they desire""
 dvg_guliconfed.3.t:0 "A Guli Language"
 dvg_guliconfed.3.d:0 "There are hundreds of languages spoken in our Confederation, making it impossible to govern without spending hours translating documents into local languages! It is clear we need one language to govern with, keeping it to official circles of course!"
 dvg_guliconfed.3.f:0 "Across thousands of people throughout all of Southern Zhourao, hundreds of languages are spoken! Some similar to others; the Guli-Qingshui refugees all speaking a similar language, yet it becomes almost incomprehensible to a Yueta man living along the banks of the Yongding. Allowing this problem to be ever-present in our government will only cause further problems to our young state, making it impossible for us to govern one-another. We must choose a language to use in our administration and educate the Guli people, they may still use their mother tongue in their own communities however, yet this can only make things easier for the Guli people!"
 dvg_guliconfed.3.a:0 "As directed by the Yaluo, we shall use Mandarin"
 dvg_guliconfed.3.b:0 "We will use the language of the Guli-Qingshui; the original Guli!"
 dvg_guliconfed.3.c:0 "Yueta is already widespread, let us adopt that language"
 dvg_guliconfed.3.da:0 "Perhaps Yilao? It is similar to several other languages near the Yongding's mouth"
 dvg_guliconfed.3.e:0 "I have heard that Waerji is easy to learn"
 dvg_guliconfed.3.fa:0 "No, no, we must preserve our own individuality, let the status-quo remain!"
 dvg_guliconfed.4.t:0 "Yushan Agency"
 dvg_guliconfed.4.d:0 "On paper it's been designated as the Yushan Agency, yet in reality the Agency is an engineer's militia, trained in both keeping peace throughout our confederation, yet also constructing our roads and buildings to further our modernisation efforts! This militia will inevitably be disbanded eventually, with a 5-year contract being agreed upon."
 dvg_guliconfed.4.f:0 "All the papers have been signed and the equipment has been gathered, thanks in part to the genorosity of the Yaluo, now all we need to do is give the go-ahead to the teams! Contracts have been given and signed by each member of the militia, yet we don't need to send them to work right away, perhaps there might be a better opportunity to put the agency in use? Yet we should act soon... we cannot waste our investments!"
 dvg_guliconfed.4.a:0 "Onwards to a new Guli nation!"
 dvg_guliconfed.4.b:0 "Perhaps now is not the right time..."
 dvg_guliconfed.5.t:0 "The Yaluo Support our reforms!"
 dvg_guliconfed.5.d:0 "We have recieved a nod of approval from Qingshui as we push our confederation forwards, with the Yaluo congratulating us on our current reforms"
 dvg_guliconfed.5.f:0 "With the adoption of new laws, institutions and technologies, the Yaluo have congratulated us with an envoy from Qingshui. Seeing us as we liken ourselves to them, the Yaluo welcome us with open arms as we move into their idea of a modern nation! "Today we are equals, Hongshan and Zhourao we can stand beside each other and call each other family, together both Yushan and Qingshui march forward, arm-in-arm together as one!" - Excerpt of a the Yaluo envoy's speech held in Yushan."
 dvg_guliconfed.5.a:0 "Yes... together as one..."
 dvg_guliconfed.6.t:0 "The Yaluo Support our reforms!"
 dvg_guliconfed.6.d:0 "We have recieved a nod of approval from Qingshui as we push our confederation forwards, with the Yaluo congratulating us on our current reforms"
 dvg_guliconfed.6.f:0 "With the adoption of new laws, institutions and technologies, the Yaluo have congratulated us with an envoy from Qingshui. Seeing us as we develop our own Hongshan identity and bring our nation from merely one in name to a modern state, they welcome us with open arms, willing to back us as we persue a wider Hongshan movement! "Today, we congratuate the Hongshan on their achievements, the conbination of Yaluo traditions with the Hongshan identity has been transformative to Hongshan society, the path behind them has not been an easy one. Today we celebrate our differences as Hongshan and Zhourao live beside one another, seeing each other as families and together as two as we each move forwards!" - Excerpt of a the Yaluo envoy's speech held in Yushan."
 dvg_guliconfed.6.a:0 "Yes, together as two!"
 dvg_guliconfed.7.t:0 "The Guli request the Xishan-Zhongxi Frontier"
 dvg_guliconfed.7.d:0 "The Xishan-Zhongxi Frontier, being a newly pacafied municipality of the League, is still largely out of the reach of Qingshui and is still ruled by local Hongshan tribes, the Guli have proposed that they take control over the territory to more effectively govern it."
 dvg_guliconfed.7.f:0 "A Guli envoy has made it to our capital to discuss the matter of the Xishan-Zhongxi Frontier, whilst the area is resource-rich, governing the area has not been particularly easy, with frontier wars still a regular occurance and the failed 1834 Pacification War against several tribes resulting in disaster! The Guli have approached us requesting the frontier, citing their experience with tribal governance and their Hongshan majority rule, whilst it would mark the loss of a small territory for us, it may be to the benefit of the both of our nations..."
 dvg_guliconfed.7.a:0 "No, the frontier is better under our governance"
 dvg_guliconfed.7.b:0 "They are quite right, transfer the frontier to the Guli"
 dvg_guliconfed.8.t:0 "The Yaluo Decline"
 dvg_guliconfed.8.d:0 "The Yaluo have decided that the Xishan-Zhongxi Frontier would be better managed under thier governance."
 dvg_guliconfed.8.f:0 "An envoy arrives in Yushan before swiftly turning back down the road to Qingshui, not staying a moment longer than he needs to! "Whilst we see the Guli leadership to be adept and thoughtful as per Yaluo guidance, we do not see governing the Xishan-Zhongxi Frontier to be of their benefit. It would be for the better of both Qingshui's bureaucrats and Yushan's tribesmen to keep the status quo", the letter reads."
 dvg_guliconfed.8.a:0 "Nothing lost, nothing gained"
 dvg_guliconfed.9.t:0 "The Yaluo Accept"
 dvg_guliconfed.9.d:0 "The Yaluo have decided that the Xishan-Zhongxi Frontier would be better managed under our governance!"
 dvg_guliconfed.9.f:0 "An envoy arrives in Yushan, taking his time to admire the sights of Yushan whilst leaving us with a letter from Qingshui, stamped with the seal of Zhongxi. "Agreeable points have come to our attention from the Guli administration, as the League sees it fit, the Xishan-Zhongxi Frontier shall be transferred to the Guli province of Yongling upon the arrival of this letter..." the letter continues to describe the next few months of the transfer process."
 dvg_guliconfed.9.a:0 "Begin integrating the frontier at once!"
