 je_found_yushan:0 "Found Yushan"
 je_found_yushan_reason:0 "Yushan - as it has been designated by the Yaluo - is to be the site for the Guli capital. As of now our seat of government is located in Qingshui, it is imperative that we establish Yushan and relocate our seat of government there to begin effectively managing our country!"
 je_guli_language:0 "Language of the People"
 je_guli_language_reason:0 "The ambitions of the confederation can only be reached by one unified language, as we look to the Yaluo education model to design our own, it has become increasingly clear that the Guli people must speak one language, both to cement our state as a nation and for one unified Guli Identity."

 dvg_guliconfed.1.t:0 "The Guli Confederation as it stands"
 dvg_guliconfed.1.d:0 "Our Guli Confederation, we are a loose confederation of many tribes spanning from the Yongding river all the way to the outskirts of Shahu! However, our control over Yongling is negligible, with the only idea of a 'Guli Nation' existing in a pitiful village designated as our capital by the authorites in Yaluo..."
 dvg_guliconfed.1.f:0 "It's clear to our government that a lot of work lays ahead of us, with the path forwards unclear; shall we remain loyal to Qingshui? Will we ever realise the idea of a 'Guli Identity"? How will we adapt to the changing world around us? Questions that can only be answered by taking steps forwards towards a fate unkown."
 dvg_guliconfed.1.a:0 "We have an uncertain future, to be sure."
 dvg_guliconfed.2.t:0 "Yushan is established!"
 dvg_guliconfed.2.d:0 "As the rest of our bureaucrats make the long journey from Qingshu to Yushan, we can finally take the time to celebrate and rest easy in the new Guli Government House in the centre of Yushan"
 dvg_guliconfed.2.f:0 "Opponents of the Guli Confederation would often accuse us of being a false state, "For one with a government outside their borders is not a state, but a subdivision unrealised!". However now we can finally show them otherwise, our modern offices and only the finest - and most sensible - furnishings for new seat of government, will surely convince any nay-sayers of our legitemacy. Yet now is no time to convince the world of our nationhood, there are more important internal matters to attend to..."
 dvg_guliconfed.2.a:0 ""Fine, fine... let them throw untrue accusations around if they desire""
 dvg_guliconfed.3.t:0 "A Guli Language"
 dvg_guliconfed.3.d:0 "There are hundreds of languages spoken in our Confederation, making it impossible to govern without spending hours translating documents into local languages! It is clear we need one language to govern with, keeping it to official circles of course!"
 dvg_guliconfed.3.f:0 "Across thousands of people throughout all of Southern Zhourao, hundreds of languages are spoken! Some similar to others; the Guli-Qingshui refugees all speaking a similar language, yet it becomes almost incomprehensible to a Yuedi man living along the banks of the Yongding. Allowing this problem to be ever-present in our government will only cause further problems to our young state, making it impossible for us to govern one-another. We must choose a language to use in our administration and educate the Guli people, they may still use their mother tongue in their own communities however, yet this can only make things easier for the Guli people!"
 dvg_guliconfed.3.a:0 "As directed by the Yaluo, we shall use Mandarin"
 dvg_guliconfed.3.b:0 "We will use the language of the Guli-Qingshui; the original Guli!"
 dvg_guliconfed.3.c:0 "Yuedi is already widespread, let us adopt that language"
 dvg_guliconfed.3.da:0 "Perhaps Yueyue? It is similar to several other languages near the Yongding's mouth"
 dvg_guliconfed.3.e:0 "I have heard that Wa'aji is easy to learn"
 dvg_guliconfed.3.fa:0 "No, no, we must preserve our own individuality, let the status-quo remain!"
