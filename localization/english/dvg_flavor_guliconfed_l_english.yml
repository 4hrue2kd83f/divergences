 #Journal Entries
 je_found_yushan:0 "Found Yushan"
 je_found_yushan_reason:0 "Yushan - as it has been designated by the Yaluo - is to be the site for the new Guli capital. As of now our seat of government is located in Qingshui, it is imperative that we establish Yushan and relocate our seat of government there to begin effectively managing our country!"
 je_guli_language:0 "Language of the People"
 je_guli_language_reason:0 "The ambitions of the confederation can only be achieved by one unified language - as we look to the Yaluo to design our own model of education, it has become increasingly clear that the Guli people must speak one language, both to cement our state as a nation and for a unified Guli identity."
 je_yaluo_approval:0 "Yaluo Approval"
 je_yaluo_approval_reason:0 "Whilst we forge our own path, we still have the Yaluo watching over us; whilst we want our own identity, the Yaluo would rather see us remaining under Qingshui's gaze. We must tread carefully while we foster our young confederation, or prepare for the Yaluo to attempt direct rule from Qingshui..."
 je_guli_identity:0 "The Guli Identity"
 je_guli_identity_reason:0 "To create a functioning confederation and achieve the vision set out by the confederation's founders, we must create a unified Guli identity. The diverse nature of each tribe makes it difficult for us to cultivate a sense of nationhood and stand on our own - taking aspects of Yaluo culture and our own various Hongshan identities will allow us to create our own, unique, Guli identity."
 je_yaluo_approval_for_yaluo:0 "Our Approval of the Guli"
 je_yaluo_approval_for_yaluo_reason:0 "This Journal Entry represents the current approval levels of the Guli confederation, changes in the Guli Confederation will affect this Journal Entry's level. This Journal Entry cannot be completed or failed, it will be removed when the Guli confederation either does not exist, or is independent of us."
 je_guli_religion_is_a_thing:0 "The Religion Question"
 je_guli_religion_is_a_thing_reason:0 "The status of religion within the confederation remains a largely undebated topic, at least until recently with the spread of Mahayana ideas following increasing rates of literacy. The Yaluo are eager to see us fully adopt the Mahayana way, however the Guli people and particulary the tribal elders are less enthusiastic."
 je_guli_language_mandarin_spreading:0 "Adoption of Mandarin"
 je_guli_language_mandarin_spreading_reason:0 "Mandarin, a language totally unrelated to any Hongshan language, is now the offical Guli language. Despite the percieved difficulty of adopting such a distant language, we must do so anyway, with support from the Yaluo too, no doubt!"
 je_guli_language_local_language_spreading:0 "Adopting a Hongshan Language"
 je_guli_language_local_language_spreading_reason:0 "Many Hongshan languages are related and interconnected, with shared loanwords and mergers, amongst many other oddities and curiosities that will be studied by the future generations. Whilst this is a boon to our efforts to adopt and teach a language to our people, we still have an uphill battle ahead of ourselves."
 
 #Events
 dvg_guliconfed.1.t:0 "The Guli Confederation in 1836"
 dvg_guliconfed.1.d:0 "Our Guli Confederation is a loose confederation of many tribes spanning from the Yongding river all the way to the outskirts of Shahu. However, our control over Yongling itself is negligible, with the idea of a 'Guli Nation' only existing in a pitiful village designated as our capital by the authorites in Yaluo..."
 dvg_guliconfed.1.f:0 "It's clear to our government that a lot of work lies ahead of us, with the path forward unclear and full of questions; shall we remain loyal to Qingshui? Will we ever realise the idea of a 'Guli Identity"? How will we adapt to the changing world around us? Questions that can only be answered by walking forward into a fate unkown."
 dvg_guliconfed.1.a:0 "The only thing certain about our future is its uncertainty."
 dvg_guliconfed.2.t:0 "The Establishment of Yushan"
 dvg_guliconfed.2.d:0 "As the rest of our bureaucrats make the long journey from Qingshui to Yushan, we can finally take the time to celebrate and rest easy in the new Guli Government House at the centre of Yushan."
 dvg_guliconfed.2.f:0 "Opponents of the Guli Confederation would often accuse us of being a false state: "For one with a government outside their borders is not a state, but a subdivision unrealised!" However now we can finally show them otherwise, our modern offices and only the finest - and most sensible - furnishings for new seat of government, will surely convince any nay-sayers of our legitimacy. Yet now is no time to convince the world of our nationhood, as there are more important internal matters to attend to..."
 dvg_guliconfed.2.a:0 ""Fine, fine... let them throw untrue accusations around if they desire.""
 dvg_guliconfed.3.t:0 "A Guli Language"
 dvg_guliconfed.3.d:0 "There are hundreds of languages spoken in our Confederation, making it impossible to govern without spending hours translating documents into local languages. It is clear we need one language for effective governance, restricted to official circles of course."
 dvg_guliconfed.3.f:0 "Across the thousands of people throughout all of Southern Zhourao, hundreds of languages are spoken. Some more similar than others - the Guli-Qingshui refugees all speak a similar language, yet it is almost incomprehensible to a Yueta man living along the banks of the Yongding. Allowing this issue to persist will only cause further problems in the future for our young state, making it impossible for us to govern the nation. We must choose a language to use in our administration and for the education of the Guli people. They may still use their mother tongue in their own communities, of course, but the common language is imperative - this can only make things easier for the Guli people!"
 dvg_guliconfed.3.a:0 "As directed by the Yaluo, we shall use Mandarin"
 dvg_guliconfed.3.b:0 "We will use the language of the Guli-Qingshui; the original Guli!"
 dvg_guliconfed.3.c:0 "Yueta is already widespread, let us adopt that language"
 dvg_guliconfed.3.da:0 "Perhaps Yilao? It is similar to several other languages near the Yongding's mouth"
 dvg_guliconfed.3.e:0 "I have heard that Waerji is easy to learn"
 dvg_guliconfed.3.fa:0 "No, no, we must preserve our own individuality, let the status-quo remain!"
 dvg_guliconfed.4.t:0 "The Yushan Agency"
 dvg_guliconfed.4.d:0 "On paper it's been designated as the Yushan Agency - yet in reality it's an engineer's militia, trained in not only keeping the peace throughout our confederation but also constructing our roads and buildings to further our modernisation efforts. This militia will, inevitably, be disbanded, with a 5-year contract having been agreed upon."
 dvg_guliconfed.4.f:0 "All the papers have been signed and the equipment has been gathered, thanks in part to the genorosity of the Yaluo; now all we need to do is give the go-ahead to the militiamen. The contracts have been given to and signed by each member of the militia, but we don't need to send them to work right away. Perhaps there might be a better opportunity to put them to work? Whatever we do, we should act soon... we cannot waste our investments!"
 dvg_guliconfed.4.a:0 "Onwards to a new Guli nation!"
 dvg_guliconfed.4.b:0 "Perhaps now is not the right time..."
 dvg_guliconfed.5.t:0 "The Yaluo Support our Reforms!"
 dvg_guliconfed.5.d:0 "We have recieved a nod of approval from Qingshui as we push our confederation forwards, with the Yaluo congratulating us on our recent reforms."
 dvg_guliconfed.5.f:0 "With the adoption of new laws, institutions and technologies, the Yaluo have congratulated us with an envoy from Qingshui. Seeing us as we liken ourselves to them, they welcome us with open arms as we move towards their idea of a modern nation. "Today we are equals, Hongshan and Zhourao. We can stand beside each other and call each other family; both Yushan and Qingshui shall march forward, arm-in-arm, together as one!" - Excerpt from the Yaluo envoy's speech at the Embassy in Yushan."
 dvg_guliconfed.5.a:0 "Yes... together as one..."
 dvg_guliconfed.6.t:0 "The Yaluo Support our Reforms!"
 dvg_guliconfed.6.d:0 "We have recieved a nod of approval from Qingshui as we push our confederation forwards, with the Yaluo congratulating us on our recent reforms."
 dvg_guliconfed.6.f:0 "With the adoption of new laws, institutions and technologies, the Yaluo have congratulated us with an envoy from Qingshui. Seeing us as we develop our own, unique, Hongshan identity and advance our nation from one merely in name to a modern state, they welcome us with open arms, willing to back us as we pursue a wider Hongshan movement. "Today, we congratuate the Hongshan on their achievements - a masterful combination of Yaluo traditions with Hongshan identity - transformative to Hongshan society at large; yet the path behind them has not been an easy one. Today we celebrate our differences as Hongshan and Zhourao live beside one another, seeing each other as a family; and together as two shall me move forwards!" - Excerpt of the Yaluo envoy's speech held at the Embassy in Yushan."
 dvg_guliconfed.6.a:0 "Yes, together as two!"
 dvg_guliconfed.7.t:0 "The Guli request the Xishan-Zhongxi Frontier"
 dvg_guliconfed.7.d:0 "The Xishan-Zhongxi Frontier, being a newly pacified municipality of the League, is still largely out of the reach of Qingshui and ruled by local Hongshan tribes. The Guli have proposed to take control of the territory to more effectively govern it."
 dvg_guliconfed.7.f:0 "A Guli envoy has reached our capital to discuss the matter of the Xishan-Zhongxi Frontier. While the area is resource-rich, governing it has not been particularly easy, with frontier wars still a regular occurance and the disastrous failure of the 1834 War of Pacification still looming over our heads. The Guli have approached us requesting control of the frontier, citing their experience with tribal governance and the Hongshan customs; while it would mark the loss of a small territory for us, it may be to the benefit of the both of our nations..."
 dvg_guliconfed.7.a:0 "No, the frontier is better under our governance!"
 dvg_guliconfed.7.b:0 "They are quite right, transfer the frontier to the Guli."
 dvg_guliconfed.8.t:0 "The Yaluo Decline"
 dvg_guliconfed.8.d:0 "The Yaluo have decided that the Xishan-Zhongxi Frontier would be better managed under their governance."
 dvg_guliconfed.8.f:0 "The envoy arrives in Yushan before swiftly turning back down the road to Qingshui, not staying a moment longer than he needs to. "While we see the Guli leadership to be adept and thoughtful as Yaluo guidance dictates they should be, we do not see how governing the Xishan-Zhongxi Frontier would be to their benefit. It would be better for both Qingshui's bureaucrats and Yushan's tribesmen to maintain the status quo," the letter reads."
 dvg_guliconfed.8.a:0 "Nothing lost, nothing gained."
 dvg_guliconfed.9.t:0 "The Yaluo Accept"
 dvg_guliconfed.9.d:0 "The Yaluo have decided that the Xishan-Zhongxi Frontier would be better managed under our governance!"
 dvg_guliconfed.9.f:0 "The envoy arrives in Yushan, taking his time to admire the sights of Yushan after leaving us with a letter from Qingshui, stamped with the seal of Zhongxi. "Agreeable terms have come to our attention from the Guli administration, and, as the League sees it suitable, the Xishan-Zhongxi Frontier shall be transferred to the Guli province of Yongling upon the arrival of this letter..." the letter continues to describe the next few months of the transfer process."
 dvg_guliconfed.9.a:0 "Begin integrating the frontier at once!"
 dvg_guliconfed.10.t:0 "Our Approval of the Guli Confederation"
 dvg_guliconfed.10.d:0 "We watch over the Guli closely, sending resources and money their way as we usher them into the modern age, yet we allow them autonomy."
 dvg_guliconfed.10.f:0 "The relationship between Guli and Yaluo has always been a positive one, yet as we let the Guli begin to take their first steps as a modern state, we ensure that they tow the Yaluo line. With the Guli government being closely tied to our own, we are able to stamp any Guli proposal we see fit, approving or disapproving of any major reform that takes place within their nation. Should they stray too far from our path, we shall end the Guli experiment, bringing them under direct Yaluo administration."
 dvg_guliconfed.10.a:0 "It is our responsibility to ensure that they follow the right path."
 dvg_guliconfed.11.t:0 "The Guli refuse Mandarin!"
 dvg_guliconfed.11.d:0 "Following a government motion to adopt a language, it appears that the Guli have not followed our advice and instead adopted a native language instead of Mandarin!"
 dvg_guliconfed.11.f:0 "Whilst Mandarin is a second language of many governing officers and other officials, the Guli people speak a menagerie of languages, making governing the confederation a struggle. As per our advice, we have suggested that the Guli adopted our language - Mandarin - as we would be able to assist them in adopting it, as well as allow them an easier path into nationhood. Unfortunately, the Guli have brushed our advice aside and instead opted to adopt a local language of one of the many thousand tribes within their juristriction, this will make it much more difficult as they will need to standardise the language and adapt Mandarin characters to it. A misstep in their behalf, perhaps we should step in and correct their path?"
 dvg_guliconfed.11.a:0 "Congratuate the Guli people, they may speak any language they like."
 dvg_guliconfed.11.b:0 "Veto their decision and have them speak Mandarin, it is for the best"
 dvg_guliconfed.12.t:0 "Yaluo Supports our new Language"
 dvg_guliconfed.12.d:0 "With our adoption of a local language, the Yaluo have congratulated our current efforts and have pledged to support us in standardisation efforts!"
 dvg_guliconfed.12.f:0 "Despite advice from Yaluo, we have adopted a local language, to our surprise, the Yaluo have accepted our choice even if it means disregarding their advice. Additionally, the Yaluo have provided a framework that we can use to begin spreading our language to our people, taking a sizable portion of them and bringing them to Yushan in order to recieve further education and assist with the standardisation efforts, before finally being sent back out to their respective nations in groups to begin teaching the new language to them! Due to it being related to other languages within our confederation, it will be easier to teach it to some people, so it is not without benefits either!"
 dvg_guliconfed.12.a:0 "Now we begin to spread our new language to the people."
 dvg_guliconfed.13.t:0 "Yaluo Vetoes our Language Adoption"
 dvg_guliconfed.13.d:0 "Following the recent debates in Yushan over which language we should adopt, a letter has arrived from Qingshui informing us that the Yaluo will mandate Mandarin as the official Guli language"
 dvg_guliconfed.13.a:0 "A shame, however we cannot protest."
 dvg_guliconfed.13.f:0 "It is clear that this outcome has been unsatisfactory to the Yaluo, as they have decided to impose Mandarin on our administration over a local language. It is a shame that it has had to come to this, however the mandate of the Yaluo is not one we can push back against. Perhaps in the future we will be able to re-negotiate these terms with the Yaluo, yet we can only expect diminishing returns should we choose to do so..." 
 
 
 ###ON_PULSE RELIGION JE EVENTS###
 dvg_guliconfed.200.t:0 "Encourage Mahayana Buddhism?"
 dvg_guliconfed.200.d:0 "As Buddhist ideas and beliefs have slowly crept into the more urbanised tribes, debates have raged amongst our people over whether or not they should be encouraged or curbed."
 dvg_guliconfed.200.f:0 "Typically held around Yushan and Jianhe, which have acted as hubs of Buddhist ideas. This has been met with backlash amongst many of the Elders and many other tribesmen living more urban lifestyles. This debate has only grown over the past years and the ongoing radicalisation of both Buddhists and Dreamtime Preservationists has reached a point where we must make a statement on the debate! Whilst favouring the Buddhist's points means upsetting many Elders, the Mahayana path is much easier to tread, being already centralised and far more organised than the diverse Dreamtime beliefs held by each nation. Yet perhaps we would be better off avoiding angering the Dreamtime loyalists in an attempt to sway the Buddhist minority, but we cannot expect the Yaluo to respond favourably if we do so."
 dvg_guliconfed.200.a:0 "A more unified religion provides a base for a more unified identity, favour the Buddhists."
 dvg_guliconfed.200.b:0 "Refrain from intervening on the matter."
 dvg_guliconfed.200.c:0 "We should discourage the spread of Buddhism, it will only erode local Dreamtime beliefs."
 dvg_guliconfed.201.t:0 "Berrin Stupa"
 dvg_guliconfed.201.d:0 "We have recieved a proposal from Qingshui, detailing the plans to make a Stupa complex around Berrin, a mountain just south of Yushan and an important Dreamtime site to the Weimin people."
 dvg_guliconfed.201.f:0 "The location is incredibly picturesque, four lakes situated in a volcanic maar, with two much larger lakes being overlooked by the peak of Berrin. We have recieved plans for a large stupa complex on the site, with the stupa sitting atop Berrin and the land around the larger lakes being turned into a large public garden. However, this site is also deeply significant to the Weimin people, being the resting place of the creator-being Craitbul, who is said to lay at the bottom of Ketla Malpi, the lake overlooked by Berrin. To the Weimin people, the construction of a stupa would be a spit in the face to their beliefs and would no doubt anger them greatly, seeing the grave of their creator being defaced!"
 dvg_guliconfed.201.a:0 "No, find another location instead."
 dvg_guliconfed.201.b:0 "Permit construction of the stupa."
 dvg_guliconfed.202.t:0 "Preservationist Society Requests Funding"
 dvg_guliconfed.202.d:0 "Made up of a small council of elders, a Dreamtime preservationist society has formed and asked us for more funds to aid their efforts!"
 dvg_guliconfed.202.f:0 "As different religious ideas are debated, a small panic has set in amongst the much more zealous and dilligent elders, opting to begin documenting the aspects of their beliefs in lengthy documents, in an effort to prevent them being lost to the growing Mahayana movement within urban areas. One such preservationist society has approached our government, requesting funding for their efforts. Some within our government would rather not see funds delegated to such an effort, citing the many current issues that face our nation, yet this would be at the dismay of preservationists and seen as a sign of the confederation turning its back on its roots."
 dvg_guliconfed.202.a:0 "Do not meddle in their affairs, we have other problems to deal with."
 dvg_guliconfed.202.b:0 "Shut the society down, such ideas of the past must be left to rest."
 dvg_guliconfed.202.c:0 "Fund the society, we can spare the money!"
 
 dvg_guliconfed.900.t:0 "Fresh Ginger!"
 dvg_guliconfed.900.d:0 "With the gradual adoption of settled crop cultivation and farming, one of the first crops the Guli people have managed to master is ginger!"
 dvg_guliconfed.900.f:0 "Traditionally ginger has been able to grow in a variety of soils - yet preferring warmer climates with reliable rainfall - it has been widely cultivated across Yongling, particularly around Yushan and the Yongding river. While to other nations of the world our cultivation of ginger is simply a passing thought, to us it shows the changing lanscape of our nation and the hardiness of our people - similar to ginger in some respects, one could say. Now our people step outside again, putting tools to dirt to prepare the land for more ginger - some smaller backyard ginger patches have appeared throughout the growing town of Yushan - up-down they bend whilst they work the ground, saying hello to their neighbour across the yard as they too work on their little garden."
 dvg_guliconfed.900.a:0 "With ginger just in time for summer, nothing beats fresh ginger!"

 dvg_yaluo_dont_approve_of_guli_tt:0 "The Yaluo have decided that our reforms are far too radical and that the hand of Qingshui will lead us down the right path, tightening their grip over the confederation to the point that our nationhood is just a convenient fiction."
