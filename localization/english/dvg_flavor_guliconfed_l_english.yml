 je_found_yushan_reason:0 "Yushan - as it has been designated by the Yaluo - is to be the site for the Guli capital.

 dvg_guliconfed.1.d:0 "Our Guli Confederation, we are a loose confederation of many tribes spanning from the Yongding river all the way to the outskirts of Shahu!

However now we can finally show them otherwise, our modern offices and only the finest - and most sensible - furnishings for new seat of government, will surely convince any nay-sayers of our legitemacy. Yet now is no time to convince the world of our nationhood, there are more important internal matters to attend to..."
 dvg_guliconfed.2.a:0 ""You mean we can't establish embassies now?""
