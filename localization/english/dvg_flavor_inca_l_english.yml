 #Great Amerigan War
 dvg_inca_ameriga.1.t: "The New Neighbor In The West"
 dvg_inca_ameriga.1.d: "The Empire of the Inca has recently inflicted a cataclysmic defeat upon the Beornians, pursuing them from the Andes into Avalon. We now find ourselves at the doorstep of a resurgent expansionist power which no doubt has designs upon our lands as well."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.1.f: "Beornian refugees fleeing across the border tell harrowing tales of being driven from their homes by the Inca invaders, while now the Anglo-Lotharian population is demanding that we take revenge and destroy the “Inca menace” before they destroy us. Attempting to take down such an imposing empire would be a Herculean task, so we must carefully consider if it might not be better to seek some type of lasting arrangement with [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_TWT').GetName]."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.1.a: "No matter our misgivings with our Amerigan neighbors, we must form a coalition."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.1.b: "We shall take the Inca on ourselves!"
 dvg_inca_ameriga.1.c: "On second thought, let's opt for a diplomatic arrangement instead."

 dvg_inca_ameriga.2.t: "An Anti-Inka Coalition?"
 dvg_inca_ameriga.2.d: "Following our conquest of Beornia, [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_LOT').GetName] has pledged to liberate its former ally by bringing together a coalition of Amerigan nations against our empire."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.2.f: "The so-called 'Knights of Albion' have become the figureheads of Anti-Inka sentiment across eastern Ameriga. Spreading tales of supposed Incan atrocities and dire warnings about the might of our great leader, Sapa Inka [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName], they have stoked the flames of fear into an inferno. Already, we hear rumors of a planned conference in Grand Rivière to organize a coalition against the “enemy of peace and Amerigan freedom known as the Inca Empire”. This could be the greatest war our realm has ever seen."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.2.a: "The hour of revenge draws near..."

 dvg_inca_ameriga.3.t: "Invitation to the Grand Rivière Conference"
 dvg_inca_ameriga.3.d: "Following the conquest of Beornia, [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_LOT').GetName] has pledged to liberate its former ally by bringing together a coalition of Amerigan nations against the Inca."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.3.f: "The Knights of Albion have become the figureheads of Anti-Incaism across eastern Ameriga. Spreading tales of Incan atrocities and dire warnings about the empire's expansionist aims under its belligerent leader, the cruel emperor Washkar, they have stoked the flames of fear into an inferno. As the most extant victim of Incan aggression, we have agreed to host a diplomatic conference in Grand Rivière in cooperation with the Knights to organize a grand coalition against the “enemy of peace and Amerigan freedom known as the Inca Empire.” Invitations are being sent out across southern Ameriga, and even some European powers are considering sending delegates. This could be the greatest war Ameriga has ever seen."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.3.a: "We shall slay the Incan Beast!"
 dvg_inca_ameriga.3.b: "This is not our concern."

 dvg_inca_ameriga.4.t: "The Great Amerigan War"
 dvg_inca_ameriga.4.d: "“The contracting powers declare together that they regard the current situation of Amerigan territorial integrity as a matter of communal interest for the nations of both Europe and Ameriga.”"
 dvg_inca_ameriga.4.f: "“Animated by this interest they resolve to seek the most efficacious means for the restoration in utmost haste of the foundations of peace suiting to the rights of the nations and favorable to the well-being of the Inca. Thus the powers are determined to act promptly and unanimously with the forces necessary for realizing this goal.” — Declaration of Grand Rivière.\n \nSince the first clash between our people and the European invaders, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has valiantly defended itself against the barbarians. Now the newest chapter in that struggle is about to be written with the blood of thousands of Amerigans. An international coalition has assembled to dismantle the realm of Sapa Inka [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName], who seeks to make himself master of the continent. The fate of Ameriga shall be decided upon the battlefield."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.4.a: "The future of Ameriga belongs to the Sapa Inka!"
 dvg_inca_ameriga.4.b: "Let's wait for them to strike first."

 dvg_inca_ameriga.5.t: "The Sacking of Fort Lothère!"
 dvg_inca_ameriga.5.d: "Years ago, a group of Granadan and Quitenese barbarians brought hideous carnage to the holy city of Cuzco. While they were defeated, the act dealt a heavy blow to the empire. Now our armies have taken revenge upon the European hordes by laying waste to Lotharingia's capital, Fort Lothère."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.5.f: "The Inka seizure of Fort Lothère has seen a series of atrocities play out the likes of which surpass even the darkest days of the Lotharingian Civil War. Inkan forces, tired and ill-tempered after having marched from the Andes to the Atlantic coast, were thus given free reign over the city by Sapa Inka [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]. The result was a cavalcade of violence and slaughter with Inkan soldiers toppling statues of Chef de Aigle and King Edward and carting away their remains before a great fire was started which burned the whole city down. The unprecedented devastation of Fort Lothère has spread despair across Ameriga and bodes ill for any chances of a Coalition victory."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.5.a: "Whatever was sacred to these savages could not save them."

 dvg_inca_ameriga.6.t: "Question of Lotharian Lands"
 dvg_inca_ameriga.6.d: "Ever since its violent birth, Lotharingia was ruled by Denis de Aigle, a corrupt, oppressive despot who masqueraded as a hero of liberty. In the aftermath of our conquest, the despot's body was recovered from his bunker in Fort Lothère, having committed suicide before our troops could reach him."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.6.f: "Although he is now dead and managed to escape the fate of his Beornian counterparts, de Aigle will forever live in infamy among Lotharingia's indigenous population. A key part of his rule was touting Lotharingia as a 'land of economic opporunity', with his regime granting millions of European settlers their own plots of land, at the expense of the Guarani people who were expelled to 'reservations' in the harsh and desolate Hatun Chaku at the country's western frontier. With the toppling of his autocracy, the reorganization of these lands must now be decided on."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.6.a: "These new lands will be returned to their rightful, original owners — the Guarani people."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.6.b: "These lands will be split up into several small states, incapable of posing us a threat."

 dvg_inca_ameriga.7.t: "Reorganization of Amazonie"
 dvg_inca_ameriga.7.d: "For many years, the part of Ameriga known as 'Amazonie' had struggled on the question of race — the Antarctican planteurs desired a segregated state with Whites ruling over an enslaved class of Black people, while the Equinoxien jesuits sought a union of the races under Catholicism. Now, neither of them matter."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.7.f: "Upon the surrender of the Equinoxien and Antarctican forces, Antarctican leader Beaumont Cartier proclaimed he would fight until the bitter end as the 'Protector of the White Race' before being finally shot down while making a last stand in his sugar plantation. His Equinoxien counterpart, Robert Forestier, told his captors that his so-called God would punish us all right before he was executed at the very same church he preached at for decades.\n \nNow, with these firebrands gone, we have the opportunity to settle this question of race in our own way."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.7.a: "These new lands will be returned to their rightful, original owners — the Tupi people."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.7.b: "These lands will be split up into several small states, incapable of posing us a threat."

 dvg_inca_ameriga.8.t: "The Peace of Hullaqa"
 dvg_inca_ameriga.8.d: "Though both sides fought fiercely, neither the Coalition Armies nor those of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_TWT').GetName] were able to win a decisive victory. In the end, a peace summit was called in Hullaqa, where representatives of each nation compromised and split Ameriga into spheres of influence."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.8.f: "The [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_LOT').GetAdjective] delegates were especially morose at this news, realizing that their western lands were now permanently out of their reach, but the other powers decided that securing peace was more important. While Sapa Inka [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_washkar').GetFirstName] is privately disappointed that the chance to remake the continent in his image has been lost, he does not show it. Though peace has returned to the Amerigan continent, many remain unsure of how long it will last..."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.8.a: "In spite of our enemies, we remain unbowed."

 dvg_inca_ameriga.9.t: "The Coalition Triumphant"
 dvg_inca_ameriga.9.d: "Hundreds of years ago Sapa Inca Pachacuti enlightened his people by teaching them of Inti and how best to give praise to the sun. Now, like Icarus of the Greek myth, the Incans flew too close to the sun and have been sent plunging into the abyss below."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.9.f: "The Armies of the Coalition defeated the Incan armies after a series of maneuvers along the frontier allowed them entry into the imperial heartlands. Sapa Inka [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_washkar').GetFirstName] was cornered by the Coalition armies near Lake Titicaca and perished while leading the final charge against them. After a relative of Washkar was hurriedly coronated as the new Sapa Inka, he was made to sign an exorbitant and punitive peace treaty. Tawantinsuyu has been dismembered, with its surrounding nations stripping away imperial lands. Those Inca lands which remain have been devastated by war."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.9.a: "The sons of Inti have perished."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.9.b: "The sons of Inti have perished."

 #Andesia
 dvg_inca_ameriga.10.t: "What does it mean to be Andean?"
 dvg_inca_ameriga.10.d: "As country has now become the entity known as  [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], the question has arisen on what kind of country we are."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.10.f: ""
 dvg_inca_ameriga.10.a: "We are a melting pot."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.10.b: "We are a salad bowl."

 dvg_inca_ameriga.11.t: "A Divided Ameriga"
 dvg_inca_ameriga.11.d: "It seems that the Euro-Amerigan nations were unable to stay united in the face of war and have collapsed into civil war. The question remains on how to deal with the now much more divided lands of Amazonie and Lotharingia."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.11.f: "For those who know the history of colonization, this is a very familiar offer. After all, their ancestors were able to make similar arrangements with the natives when they came to Ameriga from Europe. Now, as natives of the continent we are here to return a corresponding favor. Already, there are Incan delegations waiting heading to the capitals of the Euro-Amerigans, equipped with treaties laid out in Quechua - not that they'd have any government officials who really understand the nuances of it of course. Details still to be decided."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.11.a: "Let's just maintain a status quo for now."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.11.b: "Demand they all submit."

 dvg_inca_ameriga.12.t: "A New Uniter?"
 dvg_inca_ameriga.12.d: "As Amazonie and Lotharingia have both collapsed, Euro-Ameriga's great adversary, the Incan Empire, has offered to protect our sovereignty - under their banner. "
 dvg_inca_ameriga.12.f: "For those who know the history of colonization, this is a very familiar offer. After all, our ancestors were able to make similar arrangements with the natives when they came to Ameriga from Europe. Now, another group of natives is here to return a corresponding favor. Already, there is an Incan delegation waiting to hear our response in the capital, equipped with a treaty laid out in Quechua - not that we have any government officials who really understand the nuances of it of course."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.12.a: "All hail our new Incan overlords! Praise Inti!"
 dvg_inca_ameriga.12.b: "We shall not be subjugated!"

 dvg_inca_ameriga.13.t: "The National Language"
 dvg_inca_ameriga.13.d: "As country has now become the entity known as [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], the question has arisen on what kind of country we are."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.13.f: ""
 dvg_inca_ameriga.13.a: "We shall speak Spanish — an already international language."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.13.b: "We shall speak a standardized Quechua — true to our roots."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.13.c: "Everyone in our nation shall one day speak both Quechua and Spanish!"
