 #Inca Reconquest Events
 dvg_inca_reconquest.1.t: "The Realm of the Four Corners"
 dvg_inca_reconquest.1.d: "For nearly four hundred years, the children of the sun god Inti have ruled the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. Our great empire once encompassed much of the Andes mountains, the sacred home of our ancestors since the dawn of creation. However, conflict with the barbarous [SCOPE.sCountry('spain_scope').GetAdjective] invaders saw our northern territories estranged, and the shadow of war has loomed over our realm ever since."
 dvg_inca_reconquest.1.f: "Over the centuries, the empire has suffered much, and changed much in turn. With war between our people and the barbarians becoming a constant reality, our traditional way of life is put in jeopardy, as more and more concessions are made in order to survive. Even then, we carry on our duty as the bringers of civilization, rendering order upon a chaotic world.\n \nFour years ago, the vile [SCOPE.sCulture('granadan_scope').GetName] barbarians and the traitorous [SCOPE.sCulture('chimu_scope').GetName] lords sacked our holy city of Cuzco in the Fifth Andine War, yet it was our mighty leader Sapa Inka [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] who saw their forces beaten back. Since then, we have experienced a period of relative stability and recovery, as support from our [SCOPE.sCountry('burgundy_scope').GetAdjective] and [SCOPE.sCountry('japan_scope').GetAdjective] allies allowed us to repair the damage dealt to the capital. This has emboldened the Sapa Inka, who now departs on a grand expedition to pacify the [SCOPE.sCulture('patagonian_scope').GetName] tribes and secure our vulnerable southern border."
 dvg_inca_reconquest.1.a: "Onwards!"

 dvg_inca_reconquest.2.t: "Mercantilism With Inka Characteristics"
 dvg_inca_reconquest.2.d: "When the [SCOPE.sCountry('spain_scope').GetAdjective] invaders first assaulted our lands, they brought with them weapons and technology we did not yet know. But though we struggled against gunfire and viral outbreaks, our great empire did not give in. It was commerce with the [SCOPE.sCountry('burgundy_scope').GetAdjective] merchants, interested in the vast amounts of silver from the mines of Potosi, which gave us the means to fight back."
 dvg_inca_reconquest.2.f: "Though the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] had originally been a moneyless society, modernity has forced us to adapt. In the last century, two ports were leased to European companies as part of our nascent mercantilist policies, though foreign merchants and specialists were subject to extensive regulations. Some years later, the Treaty of Friendship and Commerce was signed with [SCOPE.sCountry('japan_scope').GetName], bringing great volumes of Asian goods to the Andes. However, the lack of a formal currency greatly disadvantaged our economy, as we had no other means but to pay these merchants in exorbitant amounts of raw gold.\n \nIt was at the start of his reign that Sapa Inka [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] proclaimed the era of Musuqyachiy Kichariy Ima, or 'Reform and Opening-Up', and the silver bullion Qullqi-Inti became the official coin of the empire. Though the reforms greatly strengthened our economy, building a budget surplus which fueled the Sapa Inka's military endeavors, they have been controversial among several sectors of Inkan society, particularly the [SCOPE.sCulture('aimara_scope').GetName] peoples of the Qullasuyu, who saw their traditional communal lands subject to enclosure and expropriation by [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('inka_scope').GetName] lords."
 dvg_inca_reconquest.2.a: "To get rich is glorious!"

 dvg_inca_reconquest.3.t: "The Great Army of the Inka"
 dvg_inca_reconquest.3.d: "Ever since the conquests of Pachacuti, our empire's grand army has been its greatest asset in maintaining control over its myriad territories. Yet, in recent times, the question has arisen on the necessity of military reforms."
 dvg_inca_reconquest.3.f: "The leading proponent in matters of military reform is [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName]'s eldest son, the fierce [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_washkar_inka').GetFullName], who has become infamous among the Inkan nobility for his aggressive jingoistic speeches, his embrace of modern military theories, and his promotion of foreign figures such as [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_amachaq_fujimori').GetFullName] and [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_amachaq_kosciuzko').GetFullName] into the high halls of Inkan society with little care for tradition. Some even claim that he aims to remove aristocratic privilege from the armed forces entirely, instead creating a meritocratic system of ranks.\n \nWashkar, for his part, argues that innovation, whether it be the construction of the grand roads that unite the empire or the adoption of Burgundian arms, has always been the core strength of the Inkan Army, and that the increasing weakness of the Spanish Empire means urgent action is needed in order to reclaim the north and re-establish the might of the empire."
 dvg_inca_reconquest.3.a: "A grand army for a grand empire!"

 dvg_inca_reconquest.4.t: "The Imperial Amautas"
 dvg_inca_reconquest.4.d: "Meaning 'teacher' in Quechua, the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('scope_amauta').GetName] are the academic class of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], who have received their education in the Cuzco Yachaywasi, or 'House of Knowledge'. Due to their exclusive access to European and Asian philosophies, many amautas have become proponents of imperial modernization through adoption of foreign methods."
 dvg_inca_reconquest.4.f: "Chief among the Amautas is [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName]'s younger son, the erudite [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_llapa_inka').GetFullName], known for his patient and meticulous manner. In the frequent gatherings of amautas hosted at the royal palace, Llapa is known to have argued at length for the creation of a written script for the Quechua language, the expansion of railroad networks across the empire, and greater integration into the international diplomatic system. Yet while his critics declare that these reforms would lead to the loss of the empire's traditional identity and even its collapse, the prince instead argues that reform is essential to allow the rule of the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('scope_inka').GetName] to survive and even thrive in the modern age."
 dvg_inca_reconquest.4.a: "There is much work yet to be done."

 dvg_inca_reconquest.5.t: "The Succession of Khillaspu Inka"
 dvg_inca_reconquest.5.d: "Sustaining grave injuries in the recent war against the [SCOPE.sCulture('patagonian_scope').GetName], it seems the end of Sapa Inka [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName]'s reign is imminent. However, the question has arisen on who the successor should be."
 dvg_inca_reconquest.5.f: "Currently, it is disputed between the imperialist [SCOPE.sCharacter('leader_washkar_inka').GetFirstName], in opposition to his brother, the diplomatic [SCOPE.sCharacter('leader_llapa_yupanki_inka').GetFirstName].\n \n[SCOPE.sCharacter('leader_washkar_inka').GetFirstName] is a military expert and the eldest son of the Sapa Inka, respected by the nobility for avenging the Siege of Cuzco and punishing the Granadan barbarians, though he is also belligerent and prone to extreme actions. In contrast, [SCOPE.sCharacter('leader_llapa_yupanki_inka').GetFirstName], while technically not first in line according to Inka law, was viewed more favorably by his father and is a keen diplomat and administrator, though his non-confrontational style is unappealing to many nobles who dismiss him as a coward. Both men have now laid claim to the throne. Whomever is not soon acclaimed as the new Sapa Inka will surely turn to his supporters to escalate the power struggle into something even more serious. Which prince shall take the reins of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]?"
 dvg_inca_reconquest.5.a: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('leader_llapa_yupanki_inka').GetFirstName] is the rightful heir!"
 dvg_inca_reconquest.5.b: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('leader_washkar_inka').GetFirstName] is the rightful heir!"
  
 dvg_inca_reconquest.6.t: "The Plight of the Ayllus"
 dvg_inca_reconquest.6.d: "Outside the great city of Cuzco and the bustling treaty ports, most of the population of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is organized into [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('scope_ayllu').GetName], clan-based collective farming communities organized around the traditional principle of Ayni, or 'reciprocity'."
 dvg_inca_reconquest.6.f: "Since the rise of our empire, the relationship between Cuzco and the Ayllus had been founded on a sense of mutual respect, with the state conscripting Ayllu laborers during certain periods of the year, while in return providing access to imperial institutions such as healthcare and education. In recent years, however, the introduction of a monetary economy and land enclosures has greatly damaged these relations, with Ayllus belonging to the southern [SCOPE.sCulture('aimara_scope').GetName] people being purchased or even seized by [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('scope_inka').GetName] nobility, who treat the peasants with the harshness of feudal lords.\n \nFrom this crisis, [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_amachaq_samiri').GetFullName] has emerged as a rising star in Inkan politics. Having begun his life as a lowly administrator in the backwater Qullaw, far outside the zone of interest of imperial examiners and talent scouts, his passionate temperament and fierce defense of Ayni made him a hero among the local people, and the unusual prosperity of the lands under his care caught the eye of a campaigning [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_washkar_inka').GetFullName], who brought the young man to Cuzco to be trained as a governor in the House of Knowledge."
 dvg_inca_reconquest.6.a: "Without the Ayni, there would be no Inkan Empire!"

 dvg_inca_reconquest.7.t: "The Constitutionalist Club"
 dvg_inca_reconquest.7.d: "Dissent in the empire is heavily regulated and censored, but the Cuzco nobility is known to seldom express unusual ideas quite freely. In the last years, the government has kept track of a young prince from the Hurin Cuzco lineage, [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_sayri_rimaq').GetFullName], known to host meetings comprising distinguished amautas and foreign specialists, in which seditious topics are discussed."
 dvg_inca_reconquest.7.f: "Groomed to be an imperial administrator like all nobles from the capital, Sayri had free access to the knowledge stored in the Yachaywasi, and was also tutored by a Burgundian preceptor who acquainted him with the European classics. Sayri first gained renown with the publishing of a manuscript (written in the Burgundian language) outlining a proposed imperial constitution, but later retracted his work following pressure from his family, who see their son as a rebellious youth, fated to grow out of these ideas over time."
 dvg_inca_reconquest.7.a: "Quite a peculiar character"

 dvg_inca_reconquest.8.t: "The Northern Lords"
 dvg_inca_reconquest.8.d: "Prior to the [SCOPE.sCountry('spain_scope').GetAdjective] invasion, our empire consisted of three major ethnic groups: the central [SCOPE.sCulture('quechua_scope').GetName], southern [SCOPE.sCulture('aimara_scope').GetName], and northern [SCOPE.sCulture('chimu_scope').GetName]. Yet the usurpation of our northern lands has seen the majority of the Chimu converted to Catholicism, led like sheep by the treacherous pretender [SCOPE.sCharacter('duke_tupac_scope').GetFullName] of [SCOPE.sCountry('quito_scope').GetName]."
 dvg_inca_reconquest.8.f: "From the illegitimate Quitenese state, erected upon the foundations of our noble Chinchaysuyu, the northern barbarians launch persistent assaults on our mighty empire, and the border remains ill-defined and volatile. Subject to Catholic tyranny and enslavement are several noble and robust peoples, such as the [SCOPE.sCulture('muisca_scope').GetName] and the [SCOPE.sCulture('afro_latino_scope').GetName]. Yet it is not the Spaniards, but rather the Chimu traitors who represent the greatest insult to the values of civilization, having grown estranged from the righteous ways of Inti and even their own moon deity, Quillapa Huillac. With the Spanish Empire growing weaker by the day, the time of our inevitable reunification draws ever nearer, and these defiled lands will surely be once again purified under the light of Inti."
 dvg_inca_reconquest.8.a: "They have truly fallen from grace."

 dvg_inca_reconquest.9.t: "The 400th Year of the Inkan Empire"
 dvg_inca_reconquest.9.d: "Four hundred years ago, the ever-glorious Pachacuti came to rule Cuzco, and elevated it into the glorious empire of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], crushing all rivals before him, and spreading the light of Inti throughout the known world. By his will, the highlands and lowlands were bound into a single realm, and their peoples united under our magnificent dominion."
 dvg_inca_reconquest.9.f: "Despite the coming of the European barbarians, Pachacuti's empire has endured! In the harshest of climates, we remain a mighty empire, without parallel or peer! Against all depredations, we have persevered, as resilient as the mountains over which we live alongside. From the highest peaks to the lowest valleys, our domain resounds with fervent praise to Inti and the majesty and might of our empire, as we are sure to enter a new golden age under the rule of our Sapa Inka [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName]."
 dvg_inca_reconquest.9.a: "May we surpass Pachacuti and our descendants surpass us in turn!"

 dvg_inca_reconquest.10.t: "Divergences"
 dvg_inca_reconquest.10.d: "With the subjugation of the unruly tribes in the south and the reclamation of our rightful lands in the north, we have managed to stabilize our borders and reassert ourselves as the rightful rulers of the four corners."
 dvg_inca_reconquest.10.f: "We now hold ourselves a mighty empire, reforged out of the pathetic Spanish division. Even then, the last centuries have radically altered the demographic and cultural fabric of the continent surrounding us. Not only are our lands in the north now populated by several foreign ethnic groups, many of which spread ideologies and religions anathema to our righteous way of life, but the Euro-Amerigan barbarians in the east still hold our realm in disdain and will surely seek to dismantle us. All in all, the future remains yet uncertain for the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], though we may still bask in the glory of this great victory." 
 dvg_inca_reconquest.10.a: "Our Empire's might will make us an equal to their great powers."

 #Llapa Events
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.1.t: "The Triumph of Llapa Yupanki Inka"
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.1.d: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('leader_llapa_yupanki_inka').GetFirstName]'s careful preparations guided his faction to victory, enabling them to outfox [SCOPE.sCharacter('leader_washkar_inka').GetFirstName] and his loyalists, disarming them before they could even take to the field."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.1.f: "Much of the aristocracy still saw violent division over the matter of succession, but overall the conflicts between Washkar and Llapa's supporters have been less intense than most had feared. With Llapa coronated Sapa Inka in an ornate ceremony, many hope that his modernizing vision will bring [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] prosperity without excessive bloodshed."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.1.a: "Llapa shall lead us into the future!"

 dvg_inca_path_llapa.2.t: "Cuzco, the Navel of the World"
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.2.d: "Ever since the northern barbarians defiled the holy city of Cuzco, the city has been a mere imitation of its former self. Though the worst of the damage has been repaired, many ramshackle buildings and barebones temples remain. Thus, Sapa Inka [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] has begun to undertake a grand campaign of repair and renovation."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.2.f: "Roads are being paved and repaved with European techniques, temples are being refurbished, and the whole city is being given a fresh face - with room for expansion special attention is being paid to the Qurikancha, where imperial artisans are painstakingly restoring its beautiful statues of solid gold, as well as the golden layers of the temple interior, while carefully furnishing the imperial mummies with adornments of the finest quality and purity. With foreign technology mastered and subordinated to our enlightened ways, Cuzco shall soon be a truly imperial city once again, one befitting of being the navel of the world."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.2.a: "A joyous rebirth!"

 dvg_inca_path_llapa.3.t: "The First Train Line in Tawantinsuyu"
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.3.d: "Centuries before the coming of the European barbarians, our realm had the finest infrastructure in the Western Hemisphere. The Qhapaq Ñan, our widespread and interconnected network of both tanpu and cobbled roads gave us unparalleled powers of transportation and communication. Now, however, as technology continues to advance, we too must advance with it."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.3.f: "This morning, the first railroad in the empire was finally completed with the assistance of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_scandinavia').GetAdjective] and [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_burgundy').GetAdjective] engineers. The new railroad was designed to connect the important supply centers of Wanqani and Xullaxka together, Xullaxka serving as the lynchpin for all goods entering and leaving the Aimara Highlands. The Sapa Inka himself hammered in the final, golden nail, in a ceremony well attended by foreign observers. While we currently do not have the capabilities to fully enmesh the nation in the rail network, this still represents a tremendous step forwards in our ability to move people and resources around the empire."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.3.a: "The new face of the Royal Road!"

 dvg_inca_path_llapa.4.t: "Ending the Purumauca Threat"
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.4.d: "Sapa Inka [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] is well known as a pragmatic and sagacious ruler, but that does not mean he is cowardly or weak. No, he is a believer in conservation of strength, to be expended when necessary. He is also a veteran of the southern campaigns, and remembers vividly the pain of watching his father, the former Sapa Inka, perish on the battlefield at the hands of the [SCOPE.sCulture('patagonian_scope').GetName]."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.4.f: "Imperial units selected for their fierce loyalty and hatred of the Mapuche have been dispatched south to carve a path of destruction through the Mapuche homeland of Purumauca. Anyone who survives will be driven back north, either to a set of fortified settlements at the edge of Mapuche lands, or dispersed via the mitma system of forced resettlement across the empire. These are the last days of Purumauca."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.4.a: "They will defy us no more."
 
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.5.t: "The New Chaskis"
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.5.d: "The threats to the empire are numerous and we need ears and agents everywhere. Since the times of Pachacuti, the Chaskis have served as our trusted messengers, spreading the power of the Inka throughout the treacherous roads of the Andes."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.5.f: "Though the expansion of the Iron Qhapaq Ñan has made many of the old Chaski relay points obsolete, Sapa Inka [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] believes he can find a new function for these loyal citizens of our realm. The New Chaskis will be a secretive force capable of swiftly dispatching dissidents, even amongst our chosen officials who would dare threaten the empire. Soon, the sound of their pututu and the accompanying sight of their black mantle will bring fear in the hearts of the seditious — for if they don't repent, they will be found."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.5.a: "Hush now, be quiet!"

 dvg_inca_path_llapa.6.t: "The Purification of Chinchaysuyu"
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.6.d: "Now that the Realm of the Four Parts once again lives up to its name, we must prevent any possibility of resistance which might allow foreigners to pry Chinchaysuyu away again."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.6.f: "All Quitenese and Chimu officers will, without exception, be executed. Their knowledge and skills make them too dangerous to be allowed to live, not to mention that they are the most blatant manifestation of the system of conquest which Spain and its inheritors imposed upon Chinchaysuyu. To avoid inspiring their relatives to take revenge, their direct families will also be executed. In addition, our Chaskis and the native peoples of the area will be given a free hand to settle disputes against the foreigners as they see fit. Combined with a total withholding of all forms of government aid, we should soon be rid of their infection."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.6.a: "This is sacred work."

 dvg_inca_path_llapa.7.t: "The First Industrial Plan"
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.7.d: "The direction of the imperial court in the economy is an old tradition, even if its actual methods differ from those commonly employed in Europe and Asia. As our technology improves, however, the old systems of mit'a (mandatory public service) and mink'a (local communal work) are no longer sufficient to fulfill our economic objectives."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.7.f: "Thus, drawing on foreign techniques and ideas of economic development and state-controlled economics, the imperial court has drawn up a new iteration of an industrialization plan. The 'First Ten-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy of the Realm of the Four Parts' or simply the 'First Industrial Plan', calls for the expansion of manufacturing within the empire. It allocates funds for the modernization of farming and mining, as well as grant programs for factory construction. With the supervision of the Sapa Inka and his distinguished advisors, this will accelerate [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]'s economy into modernity."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.7.a: "The plan is law, its fulfillment is duty, and over-fulfillment is honor!"

 dvg_inca_path_llapa.8.t: "Runasimi"
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.8.d: "For centuries, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has encompassed a dizzying array of peoples and languages. In this modern era of centralized nation-states, however, it is necessary to bind the empire together in a more decisive manner."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.8.f: "The amautas of the royal court have now proposed that we coordinate the imperial education program and cultural institutions towards the establishment of a new identity. This so-called 'imperial identity', will go beyond that of tribes and peoples, focused instead upon the empire itself. Let our people be divided no longer — now and forever, we shall be one nation, one family of the sons and daughters of Inti!"
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.8.a: "One people, equal under Inti."

 dvg_inca_path_llapa.9.t: "Heir to the Empire"
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.9.d: "From his diligent beginnings in the Yachaywasi to his glorious rise as Sapa Inka of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] has always pursued his objectives with clarity of vision and a focused mind. Yet the coming of age of his eldest daughter pushes him into a deep uncertainty."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.9.f: "Though he has worked hard to reform and stabilize the empire ever since his coronation, Llapa fears that all his efforts could be for naught should a succession crisis arise. In his own struggle against his late brother Washkar, it was only through careful planning that the four corners not torn apart in war. From the beginning, the Sapa Inka has known that creating a stable mechanism for succession is key to the empire's longevity, and that the choice of heir must fall exclusively to the emperor, as his father once chose him.\n \nSince her birth, Princess [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_princess_kantu').GetFirstName] has stuck close to her father, listening keenly as he spoke of legislation and governance. As a teenager, she showed prodigious ability while studying in the Akllawasi, or feminine schools, alongside the future wives of the Sapa Inka, though her interests veered far more towards the subjects of history and administration than those of weaving and brewing. Though the nobilty would surely reject the pretense of female rule, Llapa's estranged relationship with his younger sons clouds his mind in doubt."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.9.a: "Will the empire outlive its emperor?"

 dvg_inca_path_llapa.10.t: "Emperor of the Socialists"
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.10.d: "One of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName]'s many titles is 'Lover and Benefactor of the Poor'. With the growth of socialist movements within the empire, Llapa sought to suppress them while simultaneously absorbing their power base. In the end, the co-opting of the moderate socialists' demands regarding welfare and labor rights has served to alienate the radical republicans, consolidating Llapa's rule."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.10.f: "Working with the rest of the royal court, a new law package has been drafted to introduce paternalistic welfare to Tawantinsuyu. The 'Beneficience Act' includes the curtailment of child labor, the creation of an expansive primary schooling system, and a generous pension available to both Ayllu and industrial workers guaranteeing retirement. Through framing the act in the language of 'traditional imperial benevolence', it has also included provisions to suppress and persecute those suspected of 'foreign ideology', and the newly-created secret police has already been dispatched to act against these dissidents."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.10.a: "A socialist subject of the empire is still a subject."

 dvg_inca_path_llapa.11.t: "Proclamation of the Andean Republic"
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.11.d: "Over several years of absolute rule, Sapa Inka [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] was forced to watch as his royal court, which he sought to make little more than a rubber stamp for his ambiitions, slowly turned against him. His flawed reform programme ended up alienating the Inka traditionalists while emboldening the radical republicans, who, under the leadership of [SCOPE.sCharacter('sayri_rimaq_scope').GetFullName], seized power in Cuzco and forced Llapa to abdicate through force of arms."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.11.f: "As he was dragged away to house arrest in the imperial palace, Llapa wondered where he had gone wrong, and which foreign infiltrators were responsible for this hostile takeover. He blamed the lingering influence of the Amachaq, the Toledans and Chimu Catholics in the north, and even the Beornian raiders. Everyone but himself. Outside the window of his gilded cage, fireworks illuminated the grand city of Cuzco, now a bastion of republicanism, as agitated crowds raved and danced and argued in the streets. The Andean Republic is to be a new type of state, a synthesis between values of European socialism and traditional Ayni communitarianism and reciprocity. And Chancellor Rimaq is the boss of it all."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.11.a: "Long live the republic!"

 dvg_inca_path_llapa.12.t: "The Travels of Llapa Yupanki"
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.12.d: "With his reforms in place and rule consolidated, Sapa Inka [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] can finally fulfill his long-held desire to travel the world! While he is gone, his sacred wawqi 'brother', a golden statue representing the other half of his camaquen (life force) will act in his place as ruler of the empire."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.12.f: "Though he is interested in touring the great cities and geographic marvels of Europe, the largest portion of his trip is dedicated to a lengthy stay in [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_japan').GetName]. Despite this, he is known to harbor a long-standing desire to visit the Kingdom of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_burgundy').GetName], our realm's most important economic and cultural partner in Europe. Along the way, he will also meet with a variety of government officials in an effort to furnish [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]'s international image."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.12.a: "Off we go!"
 
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.13.t: "The Emperor and the King"
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.13.d: "It was in Anvers that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] met the man he'd most looked forward to meeting during his time in Europe, King [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_jean').GetFullName] of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_burgundy').GetName]. The two have exchanged letters in the past, and Jean is perhaps the only European who Llapa sees as even remotely comparable to himself."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.13.f: "Both Jean and the emperor's Inka retainers were astounded when Llapa — having studied the languages of Burgundy thoroughly in preparation for his visit — not only greeted him in Burgundian but carried on most of their conversation in that barbarian tongue! The two of them discussed rulership, their personal lives, the most beautiful places in Tawantinsuyu and Burgundy, and their distaste for Catholics. The Sapa Inka's knowledge of astronomy particularly impressed the Burgundian king. Jean then accompanied Llapa on a tour of Anvers, wrapping up the visit with a show of the internationally acclaimed royal gardens."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.13.a: "The Inka Puma and the Lion de Bourgogne go well together."

 dvg_inca_path_llapa.14.t: "The King and the Emperor"
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.14.d: "Sapa Inka [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_llapa').GetFullName] of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_inca').GetName] (the Incan Empire) has recently been touring Europe, turning heads and drawing crowds across the continent. Anvers, however, held special significance to him, due to his acquaintance with King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]. The two have exchanged letters in the past, and Llapa is perhaps the only non-European monarch whom Jean sees as remotely comparable to himself."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.14.f: "Both Jean and the emperor's Inca officials were astounded when Llapa — having studied the languages of Burgundy thoroughly in preparation for his visit – not only greeted him in Burgundian but carried on most of their conversation in it! The two of them discussed rulership, their personal lives, the most beautiful places in Burgundy and Tawantinsuyu, and their distaste for Catholics. The king’s knowledge of architecture particularly impressed the Inca emperor. Jean then led Llapa on a tour of Anvers, wrapping up the visit with a show of the internationally acclaimed royal gardens."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.14.a: "The Lion de Bourgogne and the Inka Puma go well together."

 dvg_inca_path_llapa.15.t: "The Sapa Inka Illuminates Europe"
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.15.d: "Sapa Inka [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has taken Europe by storm — in terms of popularity, that is. Crowds have gathered in Anvers, Paris, Copenhagen, and all the other great cities of the continent to behold the legendary Sapa Inka and his royal entourage."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.15.f: "European savages may be easily impressed, but the tremendous attention which Llapa and his officials received during their travels surprised even themselves. Whether riding a gondola in Venice, touring the fabulous gardens of Anvers, or cutting a sharp figure near St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, the Sapa Inka has caused more than a few Europeans to re-evaluate their views on Tawantinsuyu and the Inka."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.15.a: "They were starstruck!"

 dvg_inca_path_llapa.16.t: "Twin Realms of the Sun"
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.16.d: "Over the past few days, the people of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_japan').GetName] have witnessed something extraordinary, the first-ever visit by an Inka Emperor! Sapa Inka [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_llapa').GetFullName] of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_inca').GetName], as part of his diplomatic tour across Europe and the Pacific, recently concluded his visit to the Sunrise Kingdom."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.16.f: "The Sapa Inka surprised many with his good command of Japanese, though his excited fascination with Japanese art and culture was quite unconcealed. His reception in the imperial capital by Emperor [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_emperor').GetFullName] was quite noteworthy, a grand ceremony befitting the great rulers of the Pacific. Tawantinsuyu has long been a fixture in Japanese diplomatic and economic interchange, and this latest episode will only strengthen these bonds."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.16.a: "A marvelous conclusion of a magnificent journey."

 dvg_inca_path_llapa.18.t: "The Return of the Sapa Inka"
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.18.d: "After several months abroad, Sapa Inka [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has finally returned home to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. He was received in a magnificent ceremony, with him and the royal family traveling on a special train from the port city of Uraycusta all the way back to Cuzco."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.18.f: "The experience has humbled the Sapa Inka, giving him insights on the nations of the world and challenging his conceptions of their peoples. Moreover, the cultural exposure which his court officials received in places as diverse as [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_burgundy').GetName] and [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_japan').GetName] is sure to influence the political and social developments in the Tawantinsuyu."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.18.a: "Today, the world has grown smaller."

 dvg_inca_path_llapa.19.t: "The Death of Llapa Yupanki"
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.19.d: "The Sapa Inka had fought to keep healthy over the last decade. The stress of rulership was great, but his will even greater. During his last years, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] and his imperial biographer held regular sessions in which, through dictation and interview, the Sapa Inka composed his final review of his own life."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.19.f: "Llapa expressed satisfaction at the reforms and modernization he brought about, but more importantly, in having cultivated an educated people who could inherit this prosperous realm. Llapa declared his memoirs finished last evening and went to sleep early. This morning it was discovered that he was not in his bed, and palace attendants searched the grounds. The Sapa Inka of modernity was found expired on the palace terrace, having awoken early and watched the sun rise over the mountains, his face an image of peace."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.19.a: "All suns must one day set."

 dvg_inca_path_llapa.20.t: "The Succession of Llapa Yupanki"
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.20.d: "In the end, despite his meticulous nature, the late Llapa Yupanki let one detail slip: the matter of his succession. Though he seems to have made up his mind about entrusting the empire to his daughter, [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_princess_kantu').GetFullName], as he refers to her in his memoirs as 'the future of the empire', this ascent is rejected by two factions of Inka nobles, who either favor the eldest son, [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_prince_hurhi').GetFullName], or his younger brother, [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_prince_sinchi').GetFullName]."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.20.f: "."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.20.a: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_princess_kantu').GetFirstName] secures the throne!"

 dvg_inca_path_llapa.24.d: "Since the discovery of the South Pole, our geographers and scientists have repeatedly expressed the value of establishing a claim to some section of Antarctica. Now, a new law has been passed to formally demarcate Lastahallpa, the 'Land of Snow', [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]'s newest southern territory."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.24.f: "While the value of the land itself is little beyond national prestige and scientific data gathering, the expansion of the Realm of the Four Parts to another continent is nevertheless a significant milestone in our national history."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.24.a: "Even in the frozen south, Inti's light shines."
 
 #Washkar Events
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.1.t: "Victory for Washkar Inka"
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.1.d: "What [SCOPE.sCharacter('leader_llapa_yupanki_inka').GetFirstName] believed would be a quick and simple conflict instead turned into a fierce fight which raged across the imperial heartland. Even where their main armies did not clash, the struggle within the polarized aristocracy has shaken and bloodied the empire."
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.1.f: "Though [SCOPE.sCharacter('leader_washkar_inka').GetFirstName] has finally seized the throne, much of the country still bears deep wounds. Still, many hope the new Sapa Inka's bold vision will bring [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] the power to heal its sorrow and lead the empire to glory once more."
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.1.a: "Whatever happens, Inti shall guide us and Washkar shall lead us!"

 dvg_inca_path_washkar.2.t: "The Polish Cuirassier"
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.2.d: "'My acquaintances wonder why I have not returned to our Rzeczpospolita after all these years. But my friend, the emperor I serve is on par to the likes of Caesar and Alexander. He is truly a hero, a man greater than life, a paragon of rulership. Some may call him tyrant, but is it not tyrannical to let the serfs back home toil and die in poverty?' - Letter to [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_stanislaw').GetFullName]"
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.2.f: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_amachaq_kosciuzko').GetFullName]'s fate is unusual. Born in 1805 to a Polish magnate, he grew up studying in Warsaw and Krakow, but then began a life of adventure. Fighting for liberty, he participated in the Hungarian Independence War and the Sicilian Revolution. However, his adventures were costly and left him debt-ridden. To escape the debts he left his old life and took a ship to [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_atlantia').GetName], where he heard stories about the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. Becoming fascinated, he traveled to our realm and presented himself as a military advisor. His worth was tested and proven in cavalry victories against José de Herrera and Llapa Yupanki. Impressed, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] made Mikolaj a permanent part of his inner circle, as well as the guardian and educator of his young heir, [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_prince_tupac').GetFullName]."
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.2.a: "Even the son of a Magnate recognises the Sapa Inka's glory!"

 dvg_inca_path_washkar.3.t: "Washkar and the Qurikancha"
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.3.d: "The Qurikancha, House of the Sun, although despoiled by the northern barbarians, is still the most important temple in all of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. Both the highest place of worship for the nobles of the realm, as well as a mausoleum for the mummies of emperors past, it was once a place of ornate splendor."
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.3.f: "Traditionally, the Sapa Inka is expected to spend a certain amount of their time conducting religious rituals at the Qurikancha, leading ceremonies by day and performing sacred astrology by night. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName], however, has been neglecting his duties to focus on his military reforms and upcoming campaigns. This has caused unrest among the nobles of the capital, and the matter was eventually brought to the Willaq Umu, the high priest himself. Despite this, so far all attempts to get the Sapa Inka to return to his worship have been met with locked doors and armed guards."
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.3.a: "It seems he just doesn't care for mummies."

 dvg_inca_path_washkar.4.t: "Creation of the Naval District"
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.4.d: "This morning, Sapa Inka [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] shocked the realm with his 'Kutumasuyu Proclamation'. Highly controversial among traditionalists, the proclamation declares the creation of a new suyu, or district, representing Inkan interests along the Pacific Ocean and its coasts."
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.4.f: "Already a sharp departure from the four original suyus which give the empire its name, perhaps most distressing is the appointment of [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_amachaq_fujimori').GetFullName], a foreigner, as Suyuyoc Apu of the district, diminishing the power of the region's traditional lords while elevating the merchants of the port cities to a privileged status. In spite of this outcry, the Sapa Inka remains unbothered, working tirelessly the expansion of the Imperial Navy while charting a series of expeditions to secure scattered dots of Pacific land."
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.4.a: "Inti's light shall never set on our empire!"

 dvg_inca_path_washkar.5.t: "Of Ruins and Skulls"
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.5.d: "Some years ago, in a grand campaign against [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_beornia').GetAdjective] raiders, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] visited many villages on the Qullaw and scouted gifted youths to be sent to Cuzco and join the Yachaywasi. Among these recruits was a young boy from an impoverished and unimportant Aimara lineage, [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_amachaq_samiri').GetFullName], who has since completed his studies and become Suyuyoc Apu of the Qullasuyu."
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.5.f: "Hoping to check on the progress of his protégé, Washkar embarked on a grand tour of the southern provinces, and was pleased to find Samiri's governance had brought the region great economic and cultural prosperity. In a personal meeting in Shinkillaqta, Samiri attempted to entretain the Sapa Inka with tales of ruins and archeological findings which did not catch the eye of the emperor who was never interested in history or pottery remains found in the mud. That was until Samiri gifted him the skull of a long-gone beast, a saber-toothed tiger which roamed the Intipmarka millennia ago. While overjoyed by this gift which would come to adorn his throne room in Cuzco, Washkar also lamented that he would never be able to hunt such a mighty beast."
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.5.a: "This species shall be known as… 'Smilodon huascarisis'!"

 dvg_inca_path_washkar.6.t: "The Black Jaguar"
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.6.d: "While touring the reconquered Chinchaysuyu, Sapa Inka [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] decided to indulge in his favorite pastime: hunting. Heading east from Quito into the Amazon, his eagerness in following the tracks of a large jaguar led him to become separated from his retainers. Days later, the search parties found the wounded emperor being tended to by the inhabitants of a large palenque, led by the grizzled former slave [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_amachaq_cabral').GetFullName]."
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.6.f: "Having lived in isolation in the rainforest ever since their initial escape, the inhabitants of the palenque were not aware of the Inkan triumph in the north. Yet, encountering Washkar under attack by the beast he had been tracking, Cabral struck the animal down and carried the unconscious emperor to safety. In his gratitude, Washkar declared all inhabitants of the palenque 'Inka-by-honor', while Cabral was brought back to Cuzco and elevated to the heights of the Inkan Army. With access to the knowledge of the Yachaywasi, Cabral is known to have mastered both Quechua and Burgundian in a short time, and, fascinated by the progress of machinery and science, has already made a name for himself as a patron of engineers."
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.6.a: "Are these the principles of Afro-Inkaism?"

 dvg_inca_path_washkar.7.t: "The Antisuyu Expedition"
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.7.d: "In the aftermath of the great eastern conquests, [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_kuara_tiarayu').GetFullName], veteran of the Lotharian-Guaranitic Wars and rumored lover of Sapa Inka [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName], has been appointed Suyuyoc Apu of the vastly-expanded Antisuyu. Hoping to improve the lacking cartography of the region, he commissioned a scientific expedition into the jungle, which the Sapa Inka decided to lead personally."
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.7.f: "For four weeks, the imperial retinue journeyed along the River Amassonas, surrounded on both sides by a great wall of dense foliage, until they arrived at the hidden village of Ploumanao. The locals, descended from [SCOPE.sCulture('scope_breton').GetName] pirates, welcomed the group, having heard of the great Sapa Inka even in their isolated settlement. Washkar, while drunk, even decided to take part in a local Guren Contest, a traditional form of Breton wrestling in which the winners are awarded a sheep. Even though there are no sheep in the rainforest, the emperor liked his prize parrot so much he decided to grant the village a new privileged status as an 'free imperial city' in the suyu.'"
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.7.a: "The depths of the jungle hold many secrets."

 dvg_inca_path_washkar.8.t: "Journey to the End of the Realm"
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.8.d: "As Sapa Inka [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] is aware, everything is finite and this extends even to the Realm of the Four Corners. With the success of his recent expedition into the Amazon, the Sapa Inka summoned [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_amachaq_fujimori').GetFullName] to plot an equally-grand southern expedition, seeking a mythical territory known to Beornian explorers as the Land's End."
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.8.f: "After a month-long trek Washkar reached the so-called Land's End, really a meager collection of desolate islands, and at its southernmost point erected a shrine to Inti, establishing this site as the end of his empire. Still unsatisfied, the Sapa Inka gazed across the southern sea. Remembering tales from his youth of a vast southern land of ice and snow, he delved into the freezing waters and proclaimed that one day his descendants will explore the southern continent, and that it shall be their new frontier." 
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.8.a: "And so he wept, for there were no more worlds to conquer."

 dvg_inca_path_washkar.9.t: "Sunset"
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.9.d: "For weeks, imperial doctors begged Sapa Inka [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] to allow them to examine him, fearing he had been either infected or poisoned. Yet Washkar refused, asserting he would overcome his sickness through strength of will, even as he gradually lost his voice."
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.9.f: "This evening, Washkar finally expired roughly an hour after sunset. This marks the second death of a Sapa Inka in less than thirty years, a terrible situation for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. In theory, [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_prince_tupac').GetFullName], Washkar's son, will succeed him. Yet the powerful Amachaq of the empire may have other plans, as the prince is young and unsure of himself. With regent [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_amachaq_kosciuzko').GetFullName] consolidating his position in Cuzco while his rivals make plans in the hinterlands, it appears that Washkar's Alexandrine triumph will give way to the wars of the Andine Diadochi."
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.9.a: "To the strongest!"

 dvg_inca_path_washkar.10.t: "The Four Corners Reunited"
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.10.d: "Through shrewd negotiations and rapid political maneuvering, the Amachaq have managed to reunify the realm peacefully. The reign of young prince [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_prince_tupac').GetFirstName] is set to begin on a positive note, and great change awaits the Empire."
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.10.f: "Though their visions for the future of the empire greatly differed, the Amachaq were able to put their differences aside for the sake of peace, establishing a system of compromises and measured reform. During the regency of the Amachaq [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_amachaq_kosciuzko').GetFullName], a preliminary constituion was drafted, establishing measures through which the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] will expand its efforts in the establishment of industry, diplomacy, cultural integration and human rights. All of this ensures a bright future for the great Empire of the Four Corners, master of the continent."
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.10.a: "Washkar's legacy is secured!"

 dvg_inca_path_washkar.11.t: "A Coup in Cuzco"
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.11.d: "With months having gone by without the Amachaq being able to come to a consensus, Cuzco was subject to a palace coup by the hardliner bureaucrat [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_roqa_waqaq').GetFullName]. Having assassinated both young prince [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_prince_tupac').GetFirstName] and his retainer, Roq'a now seizes the imperial throne for himself."
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.11.f: "A staunch defender of the old ways of the Inka, Roq'a has denounced the Amachaq as 'foreign usurpers' and proclaimed himself the true son of Inti. With war threatening to tear apart the four corners, and whispers of revanchism among the Euro-Amerigans, no one knows what the future holds for the beleaguered children of Wiraqucha."
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.11.a: "Inti save us all!"

 dvg_inca_path_washkar.12.t: "Sunstorm"
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.12.d: "Four centuries ago, Sapa Inka Pachacuti ascended to the throne of Cuzco, and thus our empire was born. Now, the journey we began alongside him has been completed by the only man to surpass him: Sapa Inka [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName], the Terror of the East."
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.12.f: "After a series of decisive victories against the Amerigan barbarians, Washkar celebrated by summoning his inner circle, a group of eclectic figures known as the 'Amachaqs', or Defenders, to the royal palace in Cuzco. There they beheld the new order in the continent, drawing out borders and fiefdoms along a map on a massive table. What the Sapa Inka did not then know was how many of these battle lines were being drawn within his own realm. Yet, as the imperial banners are raised across the continent, the darkness brought by the European invaders is finally receding."
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.12.a: "And just as we vowed, the blazing rays of Inti illuminate all!"

In addition, the coming of traders from Asia and Europe has led to the rise of several rudimentary phonetic languages, used for mercantile purposes.

Instead, we will rely on the aid of the formerly-enslaved Africans, who are receptive to our rule and to cultural integration, and who have everything to lose should our empire crumble. In doing so, they will be elevated to the same status as the Quechua and Aimara subjects of the Tawantinsuyu. A new age of Afro-Incaism is upon us!"
