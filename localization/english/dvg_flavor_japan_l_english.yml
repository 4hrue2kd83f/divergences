  dvg_manifest_destiny_japan.1.t:0 "Restore order in Korea"
  dvg_manifest_destiny_japan.1.d:0 "The Korean rebellion is finally crushed and our peaceful rule over the peninsula may continue."
  dvg_manifest_destiny_japan.1.a:0 "For the emperor!"

  dvg_japan.1.t:0 "A New Shogun?"
 dvg_japan.1.d:0 " Tenno (Emperor) Komei was crippled in a failed assassination attempt and is now confined to his bed and rarely conscious. He is only in his fifties and he is likely to live for decades more. "
 dvg_japan.1.f:0 "Abdication has almost never occured in Japan and even if that was an option his heir is a one-year-old baby. Thus Prince Mitsuhito Komei’s brother has assumed the position of Sessho-no-miya or Prince Regent. Mitsuhito was already the Daiko-Daijin or Great Chancellor of the Daijo-Kan or Great Council of the Imperial Court. The Great Council was reformed following the Imperial merger with the bakufu but Mitsuhito seems intent on using it to claim even more power. Mitsuhito has gained rapid support among Japanese traditionalists-who seek to defend the “kokutai” a complex phrase describing Japan’s national and cultural sovereignty-and has even begun to be referred to by his reformist and moderate opponents as a Neo-Shogun."
 dvg_japan.1.a:0 "We shall keep a close eye on him."
 dvg_japan.2.t:0 "Return of Admiral Yusumoto"
 dvg_japan.2.d:0 "A retainer of the Date clan, Admiral Yusumoto Hideki is deeply connected to Japan’s colonial endeavors in northwestern Arcadia. A strong proponent of the Hokkaiganese fur trade and a specialist in amphibious warfare Yusumoto was the only surviving admiral of the Xiazhou Expedition the ill-fated attempt to conquer Qingqiu."
 dvg_japan.2.f:0 " Owing to his familiarity with the region Yusumoto volunteered to lead a team of Japanese marines to disable Qingqiuan naval defenses but despite his heroic efforts the marines under his command were encircled and destroyed. For this he faced exile and began travelling throughout the New World and Europe. He has written much during these travels and these writings have finally been published after his return to Japan as the Travel Commentaries of Yusumoto Hideki. While a fascinating picture of the ways of other nations the book also contains Yusumoto’s ruminations on the failure of Xiazhou his arguments and suggestions for reforming the military and some rather liberal statements on egalitarianism."
 dvg_japan.2.a:0 "The national military must never be hostile to reason."
 dvg_japan.2.b:0 "If he likes Europe and the New World so much, why not send him back there?"

 dvg_japan.3.t:0 "The Military Question"
 dvg_japan.3.d:0 "Yusumoto's return to Japan and the publication of his Travel Commentaries has ignited a firestorm of controversy all centered around the military."
 dvg_japan.3.f:0 "The reformists argue that it was Western aid which tipped the scales in Qingqiu’s favor and thus Japan should adopt Western tactics and weapons. Most daimyos sympathize with Yusumoto and support some military reforms to avoid another Xiazhou catastrophe. Traditionalists support the proposal of the tozama or “outside” daimyo a group of nobles who were the last to submit to Nobunaga who have proposed to allow samurai status to be earned through victory on the battlefield while stripping mediocre samurai of their statuses effectively making the samurai a meritocracy. Prince Regent Mitsuhito has blamed Xiazhou’s failure on a lack of morale and purpose for the bushi (synonym of samurai) and agrees that meritocracy could revitalize them. Debate about the Military Question has begun to rage across the nation."
 dvg_japan.3.a:0 "All this because of an admiral and his book?"

 dvg_japan.4.t:0 "Imperial Declaration on Military Development"
 dvg_japan.4.d:0 "The Military Question has become impossible for the Daijo-Kan to ignore and the time has come to decide the future of the Japanese armed forces."
 dvg_japan.4.f:0 "There are three general options. First the Daijo-Kan could support the tozama daimyo’s proposal to impose meritocracy upon the samurai an idea which the Sessho-no-miya prefers since it would ensure the preservation of the samurai in some form. Second they could draft a reform to slowly eliminate the samurai class replacing them with a professional officer corps but without any sudden shocks to Japanese military organization. Finally they could embrace the radicals’ proposal to hire advisors from Europe to teach the military the lessons learned from the Great German Wars as well as familiarize them with modern European weapons. What shall become of the Japanese military?"
 dvg_japan.4.a:0 "The best commanders of Europe shall teach us their ways"
 dvg_japan.4.b:0 "Professional officers shall slowly replace the samurai.".
 dvg_japan.4.c:0 "The Samurai shall become meritocratic." 
 dvg_japan.4.e:0 "No changes shall happen."

 dvg_japan.5.t:0 "The Osaka Incident"
 dvg_japan.5.d:0 "Japan’s malaise has led to increasing violence by reformists."
 dvg_japan.5.f:0 "In reaction a traditionalist group whose name and motto is Sonno Joi or  “Revere the Emperor Expel the Barbarians” has formed supporting Neo-Confucianism and a Sakoku or “closed country” policy. Even some traditionalists view them as a nuisance since Western trade and technology are critical for us but some of the bushi admire Sonno Joi. These samurai have now caused trouble in Osaka the most important city of Japan--its primary trade port one of only three free trade ports along with Yokohama and Nagasaki and with less powers for the Gaikoku Bugyo foreign policy magistrates. This all has led to it possessing a large foreigner community. Yesterday a small number of Sonno Joi samurai attacked the Anglois Merchants’ Association killing a trader named Samuel Gallois. A crackdown was immediately launched against the Sonno Joi on the order of Mitsuhito to forestall Western retaliation but the trade question has seized the nation."
 dvg_japan.5.a:0 "A poor way to revere the emperor."

 dvg_japan.6.t:0 "Trial of the Osaka Four"
 dvg_japan.6.d:0 "While the Sonno Joi movement has been curtailed across the nation there is still the matter of Gallois’ murderers"
 dvg_japan.6.f:0 "Four samurai known to either belong to the Sonno Joi movement or support it--Sakuma Taketo Fukuhara Hashimoto Sanai Echigo and Akane Shozan --appear to have been the orchestrators of the Osaka Incident. The Imperial judges in Osaka have found all four guilty of murder and the Dual Monarchy was content with the verdict and reparations offered by the Imperial Court. The main question is whether the samurai will be allowed to commit seppuku to keep their honor or if we wish to have them executed as commoners to show the severity of the judgement and perhaps send a message about the future of the samurai class if such events occur again."
 dvg_japan.6.a:0 "To the gallows with them!"
 dvg_japan.6.b:0 "Allow them an honorable death"


 dvg_japan.7.t:0 "Imperial Declaration on Kaikoku Law"
 dvg_japan.7.d:0 "The Osaka Incident has inspired the various proponents of Kaikoku or “open country” policy to come together to try to change the official policy concerning the opening of the country to foreign trade putting pressure on the Daijo-Kan to act."
 dvg_japan.7.f:0 "Currently only Osaka is freely open to foreign trade while controlled by Imperial functionaries. This excludes the leased ports of Yokohama and Nagasaki which have become foreign enclaves. For many daimyo further opening to trade would allow them to modernize their domains and thus there is a strong movement to open the country even more. Moderates advise a middle ground gradually expanding foreign access to Japan and loosening trade restrictions but preserving aspects of state control and supervision. However the growth of the Sonno Joi movement has left a mark on our nation and even after its curtailment there are those who believe its adherents had good ideas about preserving national integrity. What shall become of Japanese trade laws?"
 dvg_japan.7.a:0 "Kaikoku must be expanded to bring prosperity to our country!"
 dvg_japan.7.b:0 "The current system must cautiously evolve."
 dvg_japan.7.c:0 "Sonno Joi had a point- Kaikoku needs to be reversed."

 dvg_japan.8.t:0 "Christianity in Japan"
 dvg_japan.8.d:0 "Kirishitan are still present in Japan but they are not what they used to be. "
 dvg_japan.8.f:0 "Most Catholics are located in the Arima domain in northern Kyushu where they form an important minority along with the daimyo thanks notably to the Jesuits of Spanish-leased Nagasaki. Meanwhile some Protestant missionaries have entered Japan through Burgundian-leased Yokohama and have converted many intellectuals over the years and have even begun to sway members of the Musashi clan itself. The status of the Christian faith in any iteration is ambiguous at best in Japan. Formally it is not allowed outside of foreign legations in Osaka and banned throughout the Imperial demesne for example. Yet the longevity of the Christian presence and the consequences of Kaikoku mean that it has still made inroads across the nation."

 dvg_japan.9.t:0 "The Sadao Affair"
 dvg_japan.9.d:0 "Shinto is an ancient Japanese polytheistic faith revolving around the kami divine spirits which inhabit all things and kannagara the “way of the kami” upholding the nature order."
 dvg_japan.9.f:0 "The growth of Japanese religious nationalism has given rise to “State Shinto” an informal system of government-supported Shintoism. This favoritism has caused an issue in Hiroshima due to a printer named Sadao Aoko. Owning one of the city’s largest presses he made a fortune printing Western books at cheap prices. Towards the end of his life he sought spiritual advice from Buddhists Catholics and Shintoists. Sadao recently died and he willed his shop to three different temples-Buddhist Catholic and Shinto! Samurai belonging to each religion entered the city to defend their faith’s claim to the shop. After a riot in front of the shop all bushi involved were arrested. Imperial judges awarded the shop to the Shintoists but religious tensions are inflamed while the Spanish government lodged a complaint since one bushi was apparently a Jesuit!"
 dvg_japan.9.a:0 "Our religious situation is growing perilous!"
 
 dvg_japan.10.t:0 "Imperial Declaration on Religion"
 dvg_japan.10.d:0 "The Sadao Affair represents a dangerous recurrence not seen in many years a clash of samurai not over Japan’s government but over matters of faith and one which has begun to open up old wounds across the country."
 dvg_japan.10.f:0 "If we want to avoid being ripped apart by religious turmoil like so many Western nations then we must determine a national religious policy. Three options are before the Daijo-Kan. Reformists seek to establish true freedom of religion throughout Japan creating protections against religious discrimination to prevent sectarianism. Moderates want to formally establish support for State Shinto but also want to establish limited religious pluralism to avoid unnecessary conflict. Finally the traditionalists in their quest to uphold the kokutai demand extensive support for State Shinto and the explicit confirmation by law of the emperor’s status as a living kami deifying him. What shall become of Japanese religion?"
 dvg_japan.10.a:0 "The only path to religious peace is religious freedom!"
 dvg_japan.10.b:0 "We shall support State Shinto but other faiths will be tolerated!"
 dvg_japan.10.c:0 "Shinto is supreme and the emperor's divinity is undeniable!"
