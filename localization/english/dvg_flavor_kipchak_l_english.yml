While border raids with the Kipchaks still happen, it will need a drastic change in the global situation to see the Cossacks hosts back on the warpath.\n\nThe Russian principalities and Cossack hosts have been hungrily eyeing Kipchak lands for decades now. For the Kipchak to remain free from foreign subjugation, they must be united into a single nation powerful enough to resist foreign incursions.\n\nWhile none of the Kipchak khanates remain unscathed from the times of the Departure, the [SCOPE.sC('ask_scope').GetName] Khanate was the one most devastated by the conquests of the Cossack hordes. \n\nThen we have [SCOPE.sC('cri_scope').GetName], one of the most civilized of the Kipchak khanates, and in the best situation to unite the Kipchaks, but as many khanates of the steppes, it is currently plagued by the question of succession."
