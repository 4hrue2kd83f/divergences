 dvg_leeuwin.1.t: "The Basterd's Mutiny"
 dvg_leeuwin.1.d: "When Nuweflander declared independence, the Viceroy of the Cape sent his personal guard and the remaining Geuzen militias, under the command of his son and heir, to crush the rebellion"
 dvg_leeuwin.1.f: "The bastard son of the Viceroy, Aloysius, was a kommando in one of these militias. A man of cunning, he twisted his disgraced heritage into a rallying cry to garner the support of his already disgruntled fellow kommandos and staged a mutiny. In a brief struggle, in which they were vastly outnumbered, the Viceroy's personal guard was destroyed; and the heir to the cape killed. The now Viceroy powerless to stop any Geuzen revolt, Aloysius to consolidated control over several Geuzen settlements, promising to free his countrymen of Burgundian rule."
