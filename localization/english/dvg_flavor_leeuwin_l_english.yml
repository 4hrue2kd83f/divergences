 je_king_aloysius: "van Afrika, First of His Name"
 je_king_aloysius_reason: "Only a few years ago Aloysius was a farmer in a town outside of Ville du Cap, carrying the rumour that he was the bastard son of the Viceroy. But these turbulent times have given him a new fate. As the cape fell apart he found himself quickly becoming the champion of Geuzen freedom, ruling his own fief, and commanding the faithful loyalty of thousands of his countrymen who believe that he is the one who will free them from the tyrrany of Burgundy. Aloysius, of course, believes this too, but this is only where his ambition begins. Spending his youth feeling cheated out of rightful rulership of the Cape has left him lusting for power, imagining himself immortalised not only as the liberator of the Geus, but the man chosen by god to rule them. These lands will be united under his benevolent leadership, the Cape will forever know the name van Afrika!"

 dvg_leeuwin.1.t: "The Basterd's Mutiny"
 dvg_leeuwin.1.d: "When Nuweflander declared independence, the Viceroy of the Cape sent his personal guard and the remaining Geuzen militias, under the command of his son and heir, to crush the rebellion"
 dvg_leeuwin.1.f: "The bastard son of the Viceroy, Aloysius, was a kommando in one of these militias. A man of cunning, he twisted his disgraced heritage into a rallying cry to garner the support of his already disgruntled fellow kommandos and staged a mutiny. In a brief struggle, in which they were vastly outnumbered, the Viceroy's personal guard was destroyed; and the heir to the cape killed. The now Viceroy powerless to stop any Geuzen revolt, Aloysius consolidated control over several Geuzen settlements, promising to free his countrymen of Burgundian rule."
 dvg_leeuwin.1.a: "We shall drive the Burgundians from the cape"
