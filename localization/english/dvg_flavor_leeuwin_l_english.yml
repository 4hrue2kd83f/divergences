 dvg_leeuwin.1.d: "The bastard son of the Viceroy of the cape, Aloysius van Afrika rose to prominence shortly after Nuweflander declared independence. In a kommando militia under the command of his estranged half-brother, the heir to the cape, sent to recapture Niew Antwerpen, Aloysius staged a mutiny with his fellow disgruntled kommmandos, in which his brother was killed. With their military in disarray, the colony was powerless to stop any Geuzen revolt, allowing Aloysius to consolidate control and establish his own government."
