 je_lotharian_house_of_cards: "Lotharingia's House of Cards"
 je_reconquering_atlantia_reason: "Under the regime established by De Aigle, Lotharingia sits atop a house of cards as some might call it. If reforms are not made, it is possible for a civil war to be inevitable. 
 je_reconquering_atlantia: "Reclaiming Cote du Cafe"
 je_reconquering_atlantia_reason: "Cote du Cafe was once our province, but taken away from us. Lotharingia is not complete without it."
 je_lotharian_house_of_cards_goal: "If Lotharingia stays a dictatorship long enough, it is doomed to face another civil war."
 
je_reuniting_lotharingia: "Reuniting Lotharingia"
je_reuniting_lotharingia_reason: "After having been backstabbed by people who once called themselves Lotharians, we must reassemble the house of cards. As a mythical person once said, 'A house divided against itself cannot stand.'"

je_odonia_unite: "Liberating Lotharingia"
je_odonia_unite_reason: "With many turning against the old regime, it is up to us to bring order to what is left of the country."
