dvg_lotharingia.10.t: "The Return of the Golden Province"
dvg_lotharingia.10.d: "Thanks to our might, we have managed to retake Cote du Cafe."
dvg_lotharingia.10.f: "A land rich in gold mines and coffee plantations, imagine all the wealth it can bring us! It seems like nothing beats the power of threats and violence if you don't get your way, we would know very well of course."
dvg_lotharingia.10.a: "Another card for our house!"

dvg_lotharingia.1.t: "The Republic of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
dvg_lotharingia.1.d: "After fighting not only for its independence, but for the civil war that ensued right after it, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] now finds itself under the grip of war hero and despot [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName], along with his cronies."
dvg_lotharingia.1.f: "Despite not being particularly popular with much of the populace, the current ruling class owes its current position in part to their Beornian neighbors, whom they have consistently fought alongside with and mutually recognize. Much like the kingdom to the southwest, many of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]'s elites also intend to keep power within their own families, and would not be opposed to transitioning into a European-style monarchy. However, with the influence of their more liberal neighbors to the east and a declining standard of living in the status quo, maintaining and consolidating power as often been described as a 'House of Cards'. Whatever path [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] hopes to seek however does not seem to be an easy one. Corruption and economic mismanagement is already starting to plague the country and without much reform, another civil war seems inevitable."

Odds are if he dies, another [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] will probably take his place. The others may not like this, but what are they going to do? Revolt and secede? \n\n Of course, maybe we could just appoint somebody else qualified to take the reins."
dvg_lotharingia.2.a: "After ruling for so long, it is clear [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] emobodies [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]'s identity. Let's establish a new Lotharian Empire!"
dvg_lotharingia.2.b: "Who says we need another [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName]? We're a republic! Let's have someone else for once."
dvg_lotharingia.2.c: "It's too early for any [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] to retire! [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] is truly the leader of all time. Let's keep things the way they are."
dvg_lotharingia.2.e: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] has ruled over the country for far too long. Let's just peacefully embrace democracy and liberalism."

dvg_lotharingia.3.d: "Although many have decried [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName]'s autocratic rule, others are saying it might not be such a bad thing after all."

dvg_lotharingia.4.f: "After voluntarily relinquishing the power over time and seeing the country yearn for liberty, General [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] realized the writing was on the wall and that it was better to respect the will of the people. He and his cronies have retired peacefully out of the public eye. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] can now become a beacon of liberty, for Ameriga and the world!\n \n Sipping on a glass of wine, 'Life is too short to dedicate it to endless war and politics.All one needs in life is sun, soil, and poetry' [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] tells a journalist as he sits on the front porch of his farm in the Beornian countryside."

dvg_lotharingia.5.f: " 'Traitors! Traitors everywhere!' proclaims the state propaganda. The 'House of Cards' holding [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] together has shattered. The nation once known for being governed by an iron fist has now collapsed into a bunch of states vying to set aside the grip of Aigle's regime. Although it seems the majority of the country has split off from [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName]'s ambitions, there are still some in Fort Lothere who support him.\n \n 'I was born a Lotharian and I will die a Lotharian!' proclaims one soldier. For many of these men, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] is the only ruler they have ever known and may very well be the only one they ever will. For [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName], a life of war and politics is all he has ever known. To him, the unfolding situation is all too familiar.\n \n For the rest of the country however, these are the very reasons they seek a different future."

However, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] knows his country's history very well, and made sure it was repeated. 'I am Lotharingia' he tells himself as he looks in the mirror. What were these people thinking? That fate would turn out differently? Winning civil wars with [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] is Lotharingia's destiny!\n\n As order is being restored throughout the country, what was once a fragile 'House of Cards' is now something much stronger.
