 je_lotharian_house_of_cards: "Lotharingia's House of Cards"
 je_reconquering_atlantia_reason: "Under the regime established by De Aigle, Lotharingia sits atop a 'House of Cards' as some might call it, for how fragile it is. If reforms are not made, it is possible for a civil war to be inevitable."
 je_reconquering_atlantia: "Reclaiming Cote du Cafe"
 je_reconquering_atlantia_reason: "Cote du Cafe was once our province, but taken away from us. Lotharingia is not complete without it."
 je_lotharian_house_of_cards_goal: "If Lotharingia stays a dictatorship under these conditions long enough, it is doomed to face another civil war."
 
je_reuniting_lotharingia: "Reuniting Lotharingia"
je_reuniting_lotharingia_reason: "After having been backstabbed by people who once called themselves Lotharians, we must reassemble the house of cards. As a mythical person once said, 'A house divided against itself cannot stand.'"

je_odonia_unite: "Liberating Lotharingia"
je_odonia_unite_reason: "With many turning against the old regime, it is up to us to bring order to what is left of the country."

dvg_lotharingia.1.d: "After fighting not only for its independence, but for the civil war that ensued right after it, Lotharingia now finds itself under the grip of war hero and despot Denis de Aigle, along with his cronies."

dvg_lotharingia.2.d: "After consolidating power for so long without any significant opposition or reforms, De Aigle along with his family and friends have been able to enjoy a comfortable rule over the country."
dvg_lotharingia.2.f: "Without much significant opposition, de Aigle reasserts his control over the country, ensuring an even more firm grip over the country, for himself and his family. Odds are if he dies, another de Aigle will probably take his place. The others may not like this, but what are they going to do? Revolt and secede?"

dvg_lotharingia.3.f: "As De Aigle passes away after managing to have lived for a century, he passes his mantle to someone he trusted. Will the new leader be any different than his predecessor? Only time will tell."

dvg_lotharingia.4.f: "After voluntarily relinquishing the power over time, General De Aigle has realized his tenure was over and that it was better to respect the will of the people. He and his cronies have retired peacefully out of the public eye. Lotharingia can now become a beacon of liberty, for Ameriga and the world!\n \n Sipping on a glass of wine, 'Life is too short to dedicate it to endless war and politics.All one needs in life is sun, soil, and poetry' De Aigle tells a journalist as he sits on the front porch of his farm in the Beornian countryside."

dvg_lotharingia.4.a: "Vive les Lothariens !!"

dvg_lotharingia.5.t: "The Cards Fall Apart"
dvg_lotharingia.5.d: "As discontent with De Aigle's autocratic rule has grown, Lotharingia has found itself in yet another civil war. The Nouvellsatians, Atlantians, and Guarani seek independence while Odonian interest groups seek a coup to unite the country under a different regime." 
dvg_lotharingia.5.f: " 'Traitors! Traitors everywhere!' proclaims the state propaganda. The 'House of Cards' holding Lotharingia together has shattered. The nation once known for being governed by an iron fist has now collapsed into a bunch of states vying to set aside the grip of Aigle's regime. Although it seems the majority of the country has split off from De Aigle's ambitions, there are still some in Fort Lothere who support him.\n \n 'I was born a Lotharian and I will die a Lotharian!' proclaims one soldier. For many of these men, De Aigle is the only ruler they have ever known and may very well be the only one they ever will. For De Aigle, a life of war and politics is all he has ever known. To him, the unfolding situation is all too familiar.\n \n For the rest of the country however, these are the very reasons they seek a different future."

dvg_lotharingia.6.d: "Despite the ambitious efforts of traitors and secessionists, de Aigle's regime was able to reunite the country. "
dvg_lotharingia.6.f: "It is often said those who do not know history are doomed to repeat it. However, de Aigle knows his country's history very well, and made sure it was repeated. 'I am Lotharingia' he tells himself as he looks in the mirror. 
What were these people thinking? That fate would turn out differently? Winning civil wars with De Aigle is Lotharingia's destiny!\n \n As order is being restored throughout the country, what was once a fragile 'House of Cards' shall now be a much stronger and more stable 'House of Steel'. The guns that brought Lotharingia together are made of steel after all."

dvg_lotharingia.7.f: "Realizing how futile it would be to reclaim his country's lost territories, General De Aigle has realized that it was better to respect the will of the people and simply give up. He and his cronies have retired peacefully out of the public eye. What is left of Lotharingia can now become a beacon of liberty, for Ameriga and the world!"

Upon hearing this news, people all over the country are cheering knowing this long-ruling despot's rule on the country is now over."
dvg_lotharingia.8.a: "Long Live Liberty!"
