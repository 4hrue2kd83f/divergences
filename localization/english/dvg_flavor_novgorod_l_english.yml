  je_nov_non_russians:0 "Reform: Non-Russians"
  je_nov_non_russians_reason:0 "While Finnic minorities are tolerated, the farther east one goes the more hostility towards Uralic people grows.

  dvg_nov.1.d:0 "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is on a crossroad. If we do not reassert [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] sovereignty and reclaim our place among the Powers of the world, we risk catastrophe."
  dvg_nov.1.f:0 "Novgorod is a confederation of various states, princedoms, and republics swearing fealty to 'Lord Novgorod the Great', that is the city of Veliky Novgorod and its institutions. These institutions are made of three entities: the prince, the Council of Lords and the Great Veche, which is a public assembly led by the Posadnik, the mayor of Novgorod. The Republic has suffered a terrible blow with the loss of the Republic of Pskov, reorganized as a Scandinavian satellite state following the Neva War that ended in 1709. In 1836 the Republic is at a crossroad: It must centralize and reform its institutions, which would anger the princedoms and republics within its borders who rely on ancient privileges. Will Novgorod wear the mantle of Alexander Nevsky and lead Russia towards a new era, perish under the Scandinavian boot, or suffocate by its byzantine politics?"
  dvg_nov.1.a:0 "For Novgorod the Great!"
  dvg_nov.2.t:0 "The death of our prince"
  dvg_nov.2.d:0 "The city was profoundly moved by the death of the Prince of Novgorod."
  dvg_nov.2.f:0 "The Prince was a controversial yet beloved figure whose personality sternly guided the Confederation through the dangerous waters of political unrest. With ever more frequent and patient collaboration, the moderates of both sides in the Veche and the Council of Lords have found a common ground for the interests of Novgorod."
  dvg_nov.2.a:0 "We will continue to reform our republic"

  dvg_nov.3.t:0 "Death of the prince"
  dvg_nov.3.d:0 "After a long and disastrous reign, the Prince of Novgorod has finally died. "
  dvg_nov.3.f:0 "Despite his erratic behaviour, he was widely recognised as the last figure capable of keeping together the confederation. The Council of Lords and the Veche have convened to elect a new Prince but are unable to find a similarly compromising figure. Meanwhile, the confederation is in such a chaotic state that representatives from the Siberian and Uralic territories have not reached Novgorod yet. The Prince of Galich, has been the main obstacle to the election process, having recalled multiple times the representatives of his princedom from both the Council of Lords and the Veche."
  dvg_nov.3.a:0 "These are troublesome times"
