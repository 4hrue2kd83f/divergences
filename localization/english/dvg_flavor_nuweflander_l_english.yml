 dvg_nuweflander.1.t: "The Winkelier Uprising"
 dvg_nuweflander.1.d: "The only place in the cape that can produce cash crops, the Landsburgers of Nuweflander quickly became the wealthiest Geus in the cape."
 dvg_nuweflander.1.f: "When Burgundy raised taxes during the German wars, Landsburger Hendrik van Boetzelaer instigated a rebellion, forcing out the meager Burgundian garrison. He then established a council of other Landsburgers known as the Grondraad to rule the new country. Angered by the Grondraad's policies favouring the Landsburgers, a group of artisans, shopkeepers and merchants, known as the Winkeliers, rose up, forcing Hendrik and the Grondraad to flee, before establishing their own republic."
