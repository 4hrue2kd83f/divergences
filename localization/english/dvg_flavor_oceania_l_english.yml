 dvg_oceania.50.t: "The Paris Conference on Zhourao"
 dvg_oceania.50.d: "A Conference was held in Paris today among the Dual Monarchy, Burgundy, and Scandinavia, regarding the status on expansion into the three Zhourao Polities. None of the European powers were able to push their claim to the Zhourao, and have instead agreed to partition the western continent first, and then look towards the Zhourao again in twenty two years."
 dvg_oceania.50.f: "A decisive advantage was not seized by any faction, but the terms of the agreement only last a limited time."
 dvg_oceania.50.a: "This is only a temporary delay, we will set our sights on the West for now, but we will soon hold dominion over the East as well."
 dvg_oceania.50.b: "We should use this time that has been bought to build up our forces and ensure that we have the strength to resist the Europeans in the future."
 dvg_oceania.52.t: "The Demand"
 dvg_oceania.52.d: "The Anglois, operating out of their islands around what they have come to call Margere, have brought to us a demand. They demand we relinquish control of our gold ports in Zhourao. Kayu Jawa has been ours for centuries, since the continent's initial discovery prompted the Ming to grant us the right to mine it to bring tribute to them, and it has brought us much wealth. However, with the loss of most of Makassar to the Burgundians, we are in no position to attempt to hold anything any longer. We have no choice, it seems, but to bow to their demands. Some, however, amongst the higher circles, have proposed the idea of refusing the demand, better to die fighting, they say, than to die a slow death to the Europeans."
 dvg_oceania.52.f: ""First, they came for the Javans, and I did not speak up because I was not a Javan, then, they came for the Sumatrans, and I did not speak up because I was not a Sumatran. Then, they came for me, and there was no one left to speak up.""
 dvg_oceania.52.a: "We have no choice..."
 dvg_oceania.52.b: "They must be fools if they think we will accept!"
 dvg_oceania.53.t: "Makassar Refuses Us!"
 dvg_oceania.53.d: "A letter has arrived in Paris today. It has been sent to us by the Makassarese Sultan. Its content, is simple. The letter begins by calling our King companion to Satan, and procedes to launch into a horrid torrent of insults."
 dvg_oceania.53.f: ""To the Anglois King, the devil's consort, hellish ruler of a pitiful people, pig farmer and consort, dog layer and vermin keeper, stupid bastard son, whose stench protrudes itself across all lands, enemy of Allah and persecutor of his servants, hope and comfort of the dog and cattle... We will not yield to you, but we will fight you." An excerpt from the Sultan's letter."
 dvg_oceania.53.a: "How... How dare they! We will make for war at once!"
 dvg_oceania.53.b: "Err... We are busy right now. Issue a diplomatic objection, however."
 dvg_oceania.54.t: "Makassar Accepts!"
 dvg_oceania.54.d: "A letter has arrived in Paris today. It has been sent to us by the Makassarese Sultan. Its content, is simple. The letter begins by flattering our King, and ends with the acceptance of our demand for Kayu Jawa. We shall christen the new city as Fort Jersey, and set about annexing it promptly."
 dvg_oceania.54.f: ""To the Anglois King, whose majesty is beyond compare, who Allah has blessed, a heavenly leader of a righteous people... We will of course, be willing to part with the province, as a gift to your excellence." An excerpt from the Sultan's letter."
 dvg_oceania.54.a: "It looks like the Sultan knows his place."
 dvg_oceania.55.t: "The Yolngu Invasion"
 dvg_oceania.55.d: "A group of Yolngu scouts was seen crossing into our border a few days ago, and it seems this was but a prelude to a war to come. They have began another invasion of our lands, and this one, it seems, is final."
 dvg_oceania.55.f: "Allah have mercy on us, for Muslim blood must be shed against brothers."
 dvg_oceania.55.a: "We have prepared for this."
 dvg_oceania.56.t: "The Spreading Chaos"
 dvg_oceania.56.d: "Now that the lands to our East have unified, it seems that war will come to us now. Our inaction in the war, it seems, was folly, and we are now threatened by a much enlarged force from the East."
 dvg_oceania.56.f: "Allah have mercy on us, for Muslim blood must be shed against brothers."
 dvg_oceania.56.a: "We will survive!"
 dvg_oceania.57.t: "The Anglois Offer of 'Protection'"
 dvg_oceania.57.d: "It seems that our expansion has not gone unnoticed. The Anglois, noticing our rapid expansion, have extended us an offer of 'protection', bringing a large and cohesive treaty for our ruler to sign. Key among the treaty's provisions, is the recognition of the Anglois as our sovereign, and there is no guarantee that the Anglois stick to their side of the treaty. However, were we to decline, the Anglois diplomats have made it very clear the fate we will meet."
 dvg_oceania.57.f: "We have dealt with the Anglois before, and never found such a despicable and unreasonable folk. Their entrance into our region is without doubt a horrifying prospect."
 dvg_oceania.57.a: "We must submit..."
 dvg_oceania.57.b: "Come what may, we will fight for our independence."
