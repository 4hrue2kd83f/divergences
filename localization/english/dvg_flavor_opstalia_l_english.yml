#Events
 #opstalia_primer.1
 dvg_opstalia.1.t: "The Geuzen Exodus"
 dvg_opstalia.1.d: "When Burgundian colonisation of the Cape began, thousands of dutch settlers were lured here, believing that they would find greater autonomy and economic opportunity. "
 dvg_opstalia.1.f: "They did not. Discrimination by the Burgundian administration left most settlers destitute, the viceroy of the cape labelling them 'Geus' (beggars). This led to groups of settlers, known as trekkers, migrating away from Burgundian control to found their own settlements further inland. One group, led by a peasant named Dierick, founded an incredibly prosperous settlement, now known as Dierickstadt, which has become the de facto capitol of the Geus north of the cape."
 dvg_opstalia.1.a: "Surely the Burgundians can't reach us here."

 #opstalia_primer.2
 dvg_opstalia.2.t: "The Boetzelaer Administration"
 dvg_opstalia.2.d: "When Nuweflander declared independence from Burgundy, the leader of the trekker militias; Lodewik Dierickx, extended his support to the Grondraad hoping to push the Burgundians further from his territory and gain an ally with access to the sea. "
 dvg_opstalia.2.f: "When the Grondraad was overthrown in Nuweflander, a Geus landowner; Hendrik van Boetzelaer assumed control and fled to Dierickstadt, forming the nation of Opstalia. They are currently planning their return to power in Niew Antwerpen. However, should the policies of the Grondraad anger the locals, the militias may reevaluate their relationship with Nuweflander. A relationship that favors the new government rather than Hendrik's won't end well for the Grondraad."
 dvg_opstalia.2.a: "We will be greeted with open arms."

 #road to rickusdorp
 dvg_opstalia.3.t: "The road to Rickusdorp"
 dvg_opstalia.3.d: "Not all of the migrants came this far north during the exodus, some settled along the way and established their own homesteads in Basuto territory"
 dvg_opstalia.3.f: "Some of these settlements have become quite prosperous. Extending our control over these settlements would provide us with the resources and manpower we need to return to Niew Antwerpen... a-As well as providing them with much needed protection from native raids; of course."
 dvg_opstalia.3.a: "It is quite a long way..."

 #Trans-oranje settlers
 dvg_opstalia.4.t: "The Trans-Oranje settlers"
 dvg_opstalia.4.d: "We have recieved a letter from a group of trekkers that settled north of the Oranje river"
 dvg_opstalia.4.f: "They now find themselves under the control of the mongrel 'Vryland' government. They are requesting our protection and wish for us to take control of the area, how should we reply?"
 dvg_opstalia.4.a: "Demand that Vryland surrenders the territory"
 dvg_opstalia.4.b: "This is an opportunity to reclaim our property and remove a threat to our security"
 dvg_opstalia.4.c: "Ignore them"

 #vryland refuses
 dvg_opstalia.5.t: "Vryland refuses..."
 dvg_opstalia.5.d: "The leader of Vryland has refused to recognise the wishes of the settlers"
 dvg_opstalia.5.f: "He believes that they hold some kind of rightful sovereignty over the territories that they currently control"
 dvg_opstalia.5.a: "Then we will go and take it"
 dvg_opstalia.5.b: "We can't waste our resources over a stretch of desert"

 #vryland accepts
 dvg_opstalia.6.t: "Vryland accepts!"
 dvg_opstalia.6.d: "The president of Vryland has agreed to negotiate a new border between us"
 dvg_opstalia.6.f: "This new border extends our control over all geuzen settlements north of the Oranje river."
 dvg_opstalia.6.a: "Its seems they do understand the concept of rightful ownership"

 #fate of the bastaards
 dvg_opstalia.7.t: "Fate of the Bastaards"
 dvg_opstalia.7.d: "We have recaptured thousands of fugitive slaves as well as many of the Bastaards that facilitated their escape"
 dvg_opstalia.7.f: "The obvious plan is to construct new farms and plantations in vryland to put them to work. However; immediatley putting them to work may simply create another slave revolt further down the line. Establishing an autonomous area should keep them quiet enough to be integrated down the line."
 dvg_opstalia.7.a: "Keep the entire territory"
 dvg_opstalia.7.b: "Establish an autonomous area"

 #hendrik returns

 dvg_opstalia.8.f: "As they were being escorted back to their cells, Hendrik took the stage to declare Nuweflander's return to 'tradition, law and order'. Following the speech, the audience quickly returned to their homes. The steets have been eerily quiet ever since..."
 dvg_opstalia.8.a: "The rule of law"
