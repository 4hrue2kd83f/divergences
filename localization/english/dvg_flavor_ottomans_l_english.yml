  dvg_sick_man.1.f:0 "The road to decline began with the rise of Selim III in 1789. Selim, ever the reformer, sought to reform an Ottoman Empire that had begun to lag behind the European powers, a decline began at the beginning of the century. However, one such reform, to create a European-styled Army, was opposed violently by the Janissaries, who had Selim murdered in 1807 and replaced with his cousin, Mustafa IV. This move saw revolts by the reformer elements within the Empire, triggering the Ottoman Civil War, a period of almost thirty years of conflict between the reactionaries under Mustafa IV, and the forces of reform under his brother, Suleiman. Eventually, the reactionaries were defeated, but during the civil war, territory was lost in the Balkans. We can finally start the reforms that are required to rise again. First, of course, we need to replace the Janissaries with a truly modern military force. But in addition, we must restore the place of the Sublime Porte as the very height of civilization. Education, urbanization, and sovereignty shall be the top items of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] agenda."
