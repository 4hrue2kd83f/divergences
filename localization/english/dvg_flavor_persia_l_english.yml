 je_armenian_revolt: "Armenian Militancy"
 je_armenian_revolt_reason: "The Armenians have always considered them as a distinct people from the ruling Azeris. So long as they are discriminated against, the Armenians are likely to stage a revolt."

 je_qashqai_revolt: "Tribal Domination of the Shekhbizin Army"
 je_qashqai_revolt_reason: "The Shekhbizin Army has been composed since its inception from Qashqai contingents. The tribal elite dominates the military sphere of the realm and would see the conscription of Persians into the army as an encroachment into their authority and privileges."

 je_karkiya_rule: "High Tide of Kar-Kiya"
 je_karkiya_rule_reason: "Many wonder if the Kiya dynasty hasn't reached its high water mark. The recently ascended Rostam Kiya has inherited an ossified realm with paralysingly corrupt bureaucracy  deep economic crisis due to the disruption of trade routes  and increasing religious unrest in Ajam as the Zaydi Shi'ite monarchy attempts to enforce its creed on a population split between Sunnism and the herectic Ismaili and Twelver sects of Shi'a Islam."

Ibrahim is a proven military commander who proposed and led the invasion Gorjestan in the aftermath of the Turkish Civil War  and sees the Khanates future lying north of the Greater Caucasus Range. Ahmad on the other hand  has inherited the boundless ambition of his father  seeking a prize even greater than what his predecessor achieved - the vacant throne of the Iranian Shahanshah."

 dvg_persia.3.d: "During the wars against the Timurtash and Turkish Empires, the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('qashqai_ig').GetName] were able to help the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] Dynasty consolidate power. "

Settled by the Timurtash Shahanshah in Fars to protect the southern coastlines against incursions from the Europeans. The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('qashqai_ig').GetName] has eventually come to dominate the military, economic, and political life in the region. Their power resides in their ability to control the trade routes between the capital in Shiraz and Isfahan and from then westwards into the Levant and between Shiraz and Kerman and then eastwards into India. Acting as both toll collectors and military-security forces in Fars. \n \n The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] Shah, whose capital resides in the heart of Qashqai territory depends on the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('qashqai_ig').GetName] Ilbeg's loyalty to rule."
 dvg_persia.3.a: "We will need to stay on the Ilbeg's good graces."

 dvg_persia.4.d: "The unwritten social pact between the tribal constituencies of the Shekhbizin Empire has all but broken down as the Shah has moved to curb the power of the local Ilkans and Ilbegs.

 dvg_persia.4.c: "Let the tribes go their own way."

 dvg_persia.5.t: "Troubled Times Lay Ahead for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
 dvg_persia.5.d: "The ripples of events in distant lands are starting to hit the Kar-Kiya domains,  turning the discontent in the realm against the monarchy. The German Revolution, although destroyed decades ago, is still alive in the hearts of the Western Merchants purchasing silk in Rasht  who speak about its promises to overthrow despotism."
 dvg_persia.5.f: " All over the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] realm secret societies of intellectuals are organising denouncing the decadent Arab influence on the Zaydi state religion and glorifying Iran's pre-Islamic past. However, the opposition to the rule of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] is divided between the Constitutionalists and the Kalwatiya Sufi Order. \n \n The Kalwatiya is a congregation of Islamic Mystics following a Shayk, and its persitence within the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] domains eventually led the Order to move closer over time to the heterodox Zaydi Shi'a tennets of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] Amirs. Recently, their Shayk has started to preach herectic concepts such as the transmigration of souls and the renewal of the cycle of time through the coming of the Mahdi and the Order is starting to become a rallying point for the discontent elements of Kar-Kiya society. Meanwhile, among the Constitutionalists,  seditious talk spreads like wildfire as these societies encourage the disaffected subjects to throw off the Kar-Kiya yoke and liberate themselves through freedom of thought and progress. However, unlike the Kawaltiya who want to establish a theocracy, the Constituionalists are advocating for a more secular, liberal country."
 dvg_persia.5.a: "They shall have to be dealt with in due time."
