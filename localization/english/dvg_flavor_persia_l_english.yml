 je_armenian_revolt: "Armenian Militancy"
 je_armenian_revolt_reason: "The Armenians have always considered them as a distinct people from the ruling Azeris. So long as they are discriminated against, the Armenians are likely to stage a revolt."

 je_qashqai_revolt: "Tribal Domination of the Shekhbizin Army"
 je_qashqai_revolt_reason: "The Shekhbizin Army has been composed since its inception from Qashqai contingents. The tribal elite dominates the military sphere of the realm and would see the conscription of Persians into the army as an encroachment into their authority and privileges."

 je_karkiya_rule: "High Tide of Kar-Kiya"
 je_karkiya_rule_reason: "Many wonder if the Kiya dynasty hasn't reached its high water mark. The recently ascended Rostam Kiya has inherited an ossified realm with paralysingly corrupt bureaucracy  deep economic crisis due to the disruption of trade routes  and increasing religious unrest in Ajam as the Zaydi Shi'ite monarchy attempts to enforce its creed on a population split between Sunnism and the herectic Ismaili and Twelver sects of Shi'a Islam."

Settled by the Timurtash Shahanshah in Fars to protect the southern coastlines against incursions from the Europeans.
