  dvg_plantagenia.1.d: "As 1836 Approaches, [Plantagenia] "
  dvg_plantagenia.1.f: "Plantagenia is a kingdom facing uncertain times. Ever since the unexpected death of King Édouard I de Orleans several years ago his young son Louis I has had a regency council operating the government in his stead. This has kept the bare minimum of the government running but the lack of central leadership and the overall sense of an unknown future has left many Plantagenians feeling wary of their own government. The Peculiar Institution (the chattel slavery of Afro-Frankish peoples in Plantagenia) the opposition of Queen-Regent Catherine de Valois-Medici to it and the relations with native peoples are all putting pressure on Plantagenian society and its entrenched Planteur power structure. Furthermore relations with the Belgian Confederacy the Colombian Alliance and the Scandinavian colonies are fraught with tensions over various border disputes. If Plantagenia is to escape the chains of the past and head into the future someone will have to loosen her bonds…or break them entirely..."

  dvg_plantagenia.2.t: "Le Sens Commun"
  dvg_plantagenia.2.d: "The enemies of the king in Louisanie appear to be growing bolder. A pamphlet is now circulating in the region which combines the liberal ideologies of the Great German Wars with Louisianais nationalism."
  dvg_plantagenia.2.f: "“Le Sens Commun” or “Common Sense” written by an anonymous author the pamphlet is a denouncement of monarchism. It condemns many aspects of the Plantagenian government such as hereditary rule of the king and the Planteurs the legislature’s subordination to the aristocracy and the general lack of accountability to the people. The pamphlet also points out passages in the Bible which can be construed to be arguments against monarchism. The work finished by taking stock of Louisiane’s resources and highlighting the ways in which they could be used in a revolutionary war against the Crown! “Le Sens Commun” is rapidly gaining readers across the east coast a trend that will continue unless we address its criticisms."
  dvg_plantagenia.2.a: "A worrying turn of events."
  dvg_plantagenia.3.t: "The Coronation of King Louis I de Orleans"
  dvg_plantagenia.3.d: "Louis I has finally reached his age of majority. In an opulent ceremony filled with pomp and splendor he was coronated King Louis I of Plantagenia by the Archbishop of Nouvelle-Orleans."
  dvg_plantagenia.3.f: "Louis may be a young king but he must learn quickly. With his anti-slavery mother Queen Catherine no longer the head of state various factions are beginning to emerge seeking to influence him. Those who support or oppose slavery those who seek war against the natives or against the Belgians even those who desire an end to the monarchy…There are many who seek Louis as a pawn to be captured and used against their rivals." # The Bible
  dvg_plantagenia.3.a: "So begins his reign."
  dvg_plantagenia.4.t: " "
  dvg_plantagenia.4.d: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('louis_scope').GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [SCOPE.sCharacter('louis_scope').GetFullName] is no longer the young, healthy man he once was. His ability to perform his functions as monarch are in decline. Speculation and scheming surrounds the matter of succession and the future of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] government."
  dvg_plantagenia.4.f: "Entropy comes for all things, great and small. Whether by sword or decay, the King of Plantagenia was destined to meet an end. Decades of delayed stress, forced action, and dynamic industry have finally damned him. Sickness would have its dues soon, and the vultures in his court would gladly feast on such a grand carcass."
  dvg_plantagenia.4.a: "No man lives forever."
  dvg_plantagenia.5.t: "The Reform Act"
  dvg_plantagenia.5.d: "Tensions amongst white Plantagenians particularly between the upper classes of Nouvelle-France and the emerging middle class of the Louisianais smallholders are threatening to tear the nation apart. To avert rebellion monarchists have met with Louisianais politicians to draft a new legal document to enshrine the rights of Plantagenians. "
  dvg_plantagenia.5.f: "The new “Reform Act” is a sweeping expansion of Plantagenian voting and public assembly rights including the end of censitary suffrage critically weakening the Planteurs’ grip on political power. Projections for the next elections show significant losses for the Planteurs in places where they were traditionally able to exclude poorer whites from voting. Plantagenia may still be a land of master and slave but the dawn of bourgeois civil society and middle class-driven politics appears to have come."
  dvg_plantagenia.5.a: "And thus begins the era of the common (White) man."

  dvg_plantagenia.6.d: "The growing resentment of the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('powerful_ig_scope').GetName] is becoming difficult to ignore. These powerful elites wield great sway in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], and their lack of inclusion in government further turns them against [SCOPE.sCharacter('louis_scope').GetFirstName]'s [GetLawType('law_monarchy').GetName]."
  dvg_plantagenia.6.f: "Generals wear finery, and ship officers flaunt lavish gifts beyond their stations. Enlisted troops speak so highly of the civilian ministers that one might question their true loyalties. Meanwhile, those same ministers begin overstepping their bounds. With the armed forces trained enough to look away, who would stop them from taking what they demand?"
  dvg_plantagenia.6.f2: ""My son, come. You are coming of age now, and one day I will be too old to work this estate. Look over this balcony and take in what you see. It is yours. The peons in the fields are yours. The coffee in this field and the cows in the next are also yours. The town, its people, and the very forests are yours. And I'm told your days at university are well spent. That ministerial seat you eye, if you work hard for it, will also be yours. And so it will also be for your son.""
  dvg_plantagenia.6.a: "This warrants careful attention."
  dvg_plantagenia.7.t: "Enduring Kingdom"
  dvg_plantagenia.7.d: "With the solemn passing of King Louis I, a week of mourning has bee declared across [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameNoFormatting]. His reign will surely be remembered as one of the greatest periods of our nation's history. Plans must now begin for the coronation of [SCOPE.sCharacter('new_brz_monarch_scope').GetFullName], who the people look to with admiration and respect to lead them onwards."
  dvg_plantagenia.7.f: "Old tales once held that Heaven weeps when a great man dies. When King Edouard of Plantegenet died, there was scarcely a moment without rain. Tens of thousands lined his funeral procession, wearing black and flying Plantageniaian flags. Dignitaries from as far as Japan bore witness to the event, each laying forth their own tokens of respect.\n\nThe heavy crown that once harrowed [SCOPE.sCharacter('new_brz_monarch_scope').GetHerHis]'s father now loomed over [SCOPE.sCharacter('new_brz_monarch_scope').GetHerHis].

  dvg_plantagenia.8.t: "The End of the Plantagenian Monarchy"
  dvg_plantagenia.8.d: "Feeling alienated by the recent turn of events in the kingdom, the Planteurs have decided to take action. In a bloodless coup, the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('armed_forces_ig').GetName] and [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('landowners_ig').GetName] have overthrown the [GetLawType('law_monarchy').GetName] of [SCOPE.sCharacter('louis_scope').GetFullName] and proclaimed a [GetLawType('law_presidential_republic').GetName]."
  dvg_plantagenia.8.f: "“Fellow citizens : The people and the armed forces in perfect harmony of sentiment with our fellow-citizens have just decreed the dethronement of the Royal dynasty and consequently the extinction of the representative monarchical system of government. As an immediate result of this national revolution of a character wholly patriotic a provisional government has just been instituted whose principal mission is to guarantee its citizens’ rights to liberty and property. Elections shall be held with all deliberate speed to compose the new Republican government.” – Proclamation of the Republic\n\nAfter Louis’s decree the Planteurs finally gained the strength to undo him. In an emergency session of the legislature two laws were passed : one annulling the Golden Law and another abolishing the Plantagenian monarchy and establishing a republic. Planteur Marechal Pierre de Maurras has been sworn in as the republic’s new president but it seems that the royal family has already fled..."
