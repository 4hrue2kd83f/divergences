Unfortunately it is also quite vulnerable to hurricanes the massive tropical storms which occasionally sweep into the Caribbean. "

A few days ago a giant storm made landfall on the coast. With little time to react many Nouvelle-Orleaners were caught in the maelstrom of pounding rain and winds strong enough to embed splinters of wood in hardened cement!

Apache braves on horseback descended upon the town picking off lone [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] and brutalizing the settlers who attempted to defend the area. It was only the timely intervention of a local frontier patrol which prevented them from pillaging the whole town though they still managed to escape.

While most townspeople were still asleep another horde of Apache braves rode straight into the town. Since the last raid many townspeople had acquired weapons and so were better prepared to fight. The result was street-by-street fighting between settlers and Apaches and the reduced amount of looting was balanced out by the increased bloodshed across the town. The incident has animated westerners against the tribes of the frontier and now western politicians are now calling on the government to take a stronger stance on the Apache threat and pacify the west. §RYet if we do so we would be moving away men and resources that might otherwise be allocated defending against the Belgians who seek to reclaim their lost southern lands..."

While he had visited La Galette for the purpose of officially designating it as a royal city he has been enraptured by this “Gateway to the West.” He spent quite a bit of time inspecting the outlands of the region much to the shock of the locals and even conducted some of his tours while riding on horseback.

  dvg_plantagenia.13.f: "Frontier towns and settlements across the plains have become accustomed to the sight of the king riding into town  his entourage scrambling to follow. Louis particularly enjoyed engaging in buffalo hunts with royal Indian auxiliaries to the point where his white minders were somewhat embarrassed by the familiar and fraternizing manner with which he treated them. Nouvelle-Orleans and the other cities of culture and refinement back west have been astonished by the king’s plebian activities but he has befriended quite a few influential politicians and family patriarchs in the region. What’s more the image of the dashing young “Roi-Vacher” riding across the plains with the same attire and attitude as the other frontiersmen is quickly winning the hearts of the people of northwestern [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."

The conditions upon these fields are said by radical liberals to be utterly brutal dominated by torture and violence. The  [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('planteurs_ig').GetName] however, swear up and down that they are the preservers of chivalry tending to their slaves with the benevolence of a parent. As codified in the Second Charter of 1814 the censitary vote system weighs the impact of slaveowners according to their slaves even though the slaves themselves cannot vote. This means that the upper house is completely dominated by  [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('planteurs_ig').GetName] interests and the lower house thoroughly influenced by them as well.

Unlike many mulattos he is technically legitimate as his father married his slave mother in secret. Sent to Europe for his studies he fought for the liberals in the Hungarian Revolution. The existence of “yellow” (mulatto) nobles has long irritated the  [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('planteurs_ig').GetName] but Sir Saint-Georges is now spreading ideas of racial equality unheard of in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]..."

I feel no shame in being a mulatto because there is none. Is a mulatto not a man and a brother? Shall you weigh the hearts of all yellow men bestowing rights upon one but not another because of an insufficient quantity of European blood? If a man of European paternity and noble birth can be denied freedom then no man in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] not even the richest master of enslaved negros is free.” "

Their existence has proved vexing to the traditional racial dichotomy of European whites above and blacks and natives below."
  dvg_plantagenia.16.f: "To maintain the Planteur power structure the Loi Jaune or “Yellow Law” has been on the books in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] for decades. The law sharply curtails the civil liberties of free mixed-race people despite a notable amount of them physically appearing to be just as white as any Planteur. Many mulattos are now agitating for the repeal of the Loi Jaune especially due to the influence of the Knight of Saint Georges who has made the repeal of the law his first political priority."

  dvg_plantagenia.17.f: "Unlike many missionaries the Jesuits immerse themselves in native cultures. They learn and speak their languages adopt their ways and live amongst them to gain their trust and evangelize in ways that natives can understand. Many tribes have not been receptive but the Jesuits have seen great success working with the southern Algonquins of the Southwestern Confederacy. They have converted many Indians to the Catholic faith even if the Indians don’t always uphold the proper rites. Now however as tensions rise across Scandinavian Arcadia some believe that the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SKR').GetAdjective] Confederacy may collapse. If that happens then the Jesuit networks could enable us to attempt to take control of the Southwestern Confederacy.

Louisiane the Atlantic coast of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] joined them in their revolt fomented by a revolutionary group known as the Fils de la Liberté or “Sons of Liberty.” "
  dvg_plantagenia.18.f: "In the years since our recovery of the region Louisiane nationalism had receded but never truly died. Now it seems to be resurgent. We have discovered that a second Fils de la Liberté organization has been formed with some members believed to be the sons or grandsons of the original conspirators. Animated by the liberal ideologies of the Great German Wars the Fils are republicans who demand an end to the monarchy to the concentration of power in the hands of the Nouvelle-France elite of central [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] and to the “Plantagenian occupation” of Louisiane. Drawing support from the small landowners in Louisiane the group’s fusion of Louisianais nationalism and militant republicanism could jeopardize our stability and territorial integrity."

  dvg_plantagenia.19.f: "Drafted by those who endured the mad ambitions of Charles II’s bid to become Emperor of Arcadia the Charter was intended as a compromise with the more liberal east coast. It confirms the king’s status as head of state but still remands significant powers to the legislature along with codifying the individual rights to life and property of the average [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] citizen. Yet the King wonders must these “rights to property” include slavery? Is that not a perversion of justice? Could opposing slavery break the stranglehold of Nouvelle-France? Though the  [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('planteurs_ig').GetName] will abhor it many monarchists believe that the time has come for the King to take a more active role in politics and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] is starting to agree with them..."

Yet as We consider the threats to Plantagenia We see one rise above the rest one internal rather than external. We believe that the Peculiar Institution degrades both the social and the productive power of our nation : it makes us serfs of moral prejudice.

  dvg_plantagenia.21.d: " [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]’ recent denouncement of slavery has drawn severe criticism from the Planteur aristocracy. A recent pamphlet circulating in Nouvelle-Orleans and other nearby cities “Sic Semper Tyrannis : On the Matter of Despotism and Liberty” typifies this reaction."

Louis and his council have held several meetings to address the situation and two solutions have arisen both involving the use of the royal prerogative."
  dvg_plantagenia.22.f: " The first would be the most direct : abolish slavery by royal decree. This would win Louis the loyalty of colored [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] including influential mulattos like Saint-Georges. It would also infuriate the  [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('planteurs_ig').GetName] to the point that they could likely pass a law to abolish the monarchy on the grounds of what they would likely frame as Louis’ “gross overreach of power.” The other less extreme option would be to issue a new royal charter to expand civil liberties undermining the Planteurs’ power without challenging them head on.
