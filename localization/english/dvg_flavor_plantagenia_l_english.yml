  dvg_plantagenia.1.f: "Plantagenia is a kingdom facing uncertain times. Ever since the unexpected death of King Édouard I de Orleans several years ago his young son Louis I has had a regency council operating the government in his stead. This has kept the bare minimum of the government running but the lack of central leadership and the overall sense of an unknown future has left many Plantagenians feeling wary of their own government. The Peculiar Institution (the chattel slavery of Afro-Frankish peoples in Plantagenia) the opposition of Queen-Regent Catherine de Valois-Medici to it and the relations with native peoples are all putting pressure on Plantagenian society and its entrenched Planteur power structure. Furthermore relations with the Belgian Confederacy the Colombian Alliance and the Scandinavian colonies are fraught with tensions over various border disputes. If Plantagenia is to escape the chains of the past and head into the future someone will have to loosen her bonds…or break them entirely..."

  dvg_plantagenia.2.t: "Le Sens Commun"
  dvg_plantagenia.2.d: "The enemies of the king in Louisanie appear to be growing bolder. A pamphlet is now circulating in the region which combines the liberal ideologies of the Great German Wars with Louisianais nationalism."
  dvg_plantagenia.2.f: "“Le Sens Commun” or “Common Sense” written by an anonymous author the pamphlet is a denouncement of monarchism. It condemns many aspects of the Plantagenian government such as hereditary rule of the king and the Planteurs the legislature’s subordination to the aristocracy and the general lack of accountability to the people. The pamphlet also points out passages in the Bible which can be construed to be arguments against monarchism. The work finished by taking stock of Louisiane’s resources and highlighting the ways in which they could be used in a revolutionary war against the Crown! “Le Sens Commun” is rapidly gaining readers across the east coast a trend that will continue unless we address its criticisms."
  dvg_plantagenia.2.a: "A worrying turn of events."
  dvg_plantagenia.3.t: "The Coronation of King Louis I de Orleans"
  dvg_plantagenia.3.d: "Louis I has finally reached his age of majority. In an opulent ceremony filled with pomp and splendor he was coronated King Louis I of Plantagenia by the Archbishop of Nouvelle-Orleans."
  dvg_plantagenia.3.f: "Louis may be a young king but he must learn quickly. With his anti-slavery mother Queen Catherine no longer the head of state various factions are beginning to emerge seeking to influence him. Those who support or oppose slavery those who seek war against the natives or against the Belgians even those who desire an end to the monarchy…There are many who seek Louis as a pawn to be captured and used against their rivals." # The Bible
  dvg_plantagenia.3.a: "So begins his reign."
  dvg_plantagenia.4.t: " "
  dvg_plantagenia.4.d: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('louis_scope').GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [SCOPE.sCharacter('louis_scope').GetFullName] is no longer the young, healthy man he once was. His ability to perform his functions as monarch are in decline. Speculation and scheming surrounds the matter of succession and the future of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] government."
  dvg_plantagenia.4.f: "Entropy comes for all things, great and small. Whether by sword or decay, the King of Plantagenia was destined to meet an end. Decades of delayed stress, forced action, and dynamic industry have finally damned him. Sickness would have its dues soon, and the vultures in his court would gladly feast on such a grand carcass."
  dvg_plantagenia.4.a: "No man lives forever."
  dvg_plantagenia.5.t: "The Reform Act"
  dvg_plantagenia.5.d: "Tensions amongst white Plantagenians particularly between the upper classes of Nouvelle-France and the emerging middle class of the Louisianais smallholders are threatening to tear the nation apart. To avert rebellion monarchists have met with Louisianais politicians to draft a new legal document to enshrine the rights of Plantagenians. "
  dvg_plantagenia.5.f: "The new “Reform Act” is a sweeping expansion of Plantagenian voting and public assembly rights including the end of censitary suffrage critically weakening the Planteurs’ grip on political power. Projections for the next elections show significant losses for the Planteurs in places where they were traditionally able to exclude poorer whites from voting. Plantagenia may still be a land of master and slave but the dawn of bourgeois civil society and middle class-driven politics appears to have come."

  dvg_plantagenia.6.d: "The growing resentment of the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('powerful_ig_scope').GetName] is becoming difficult to ignore. These powerful elites wield great sway in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], and their lack of inclusion in government further turns them against [SCOPE.sCharacter('louis_scope').GetFirstName]'s [GetLawType('law_monarchy').GetName]."
  dvg_plantagenia.6.f: "Generals wear finery, and ship officers flaunt lavish gifts beyond their stations. Enlisted troops speak so highly of the civilian ministers that one might question their true loyalties. Meanwhile, those same ministers begin overstepping their bounds. With the armed forces trained enough to look away, who would stop them from taking what they demand?"
  dvg_plantagenia.6.a: "This warrants careful attention."
  dvg_plantagenia.7.t: "Enduring Kingdom"
  dvg_plantagenia.7.d: "With the solemn passing of King Louis I, a week of mourning has bee declared across [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameNoFormatting]. His reign will surely be remembered as one of the greatest periods of our nation's history. Plans must now begin for the coronation of [SCOPE.sCharacter('heir_scope').GetFullName], who the people look to with admiration and respect to lead them onwards."
  dvg_plantagenia.7.f: "Old tales once held that Heaven weeps when a great man dies. When King Edouard of Plantegenet died, there was scarcely a moment without rain. Tens of thousands lined his funeral procession, wearing black and flying Plantageniaian flags. Dignitaries from as far as Japan bore witness to the event, each laying forth their own tokens of respect.\n\nThe heavy crown that once harrowed [SCOPE.sCharacter('new_brz_monarch_scope').GetHerHis]'s father now loomed over [SCOPE.sCharacter('new_brz_monarch_scope').GetHerHis].

  dvg_plantagenia.8.t: "The End of the Plantagenian Monarchy"
  dvg_plantagenia.8.d: "Feeling alienated by the recent turn of events in the kingdom, the Planteurs have decided to take action. In a bloodless coup, the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('armed_forces_ig').GetName] and [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('landowners_ig').GetName] have overthrown the [GetLawType('law_monarchy').GetName] of [SCOPE.sCharacter('louis_scope').GetFullName] and proclaimed a [GetLawType('law_presidential_republic').GetName]."
  dvg_plantagenia.8.f: "“Fellow citizens : The people and the armed forces in perfect harmony of sentiment with our fellow-citizens have just decreed the dethronement of the Royal dynasty and consequently the extinction of the representative monarchical system of government. As an immediate result of this national revolution of a character wholly patriotic a provisional government has just been instituted whose principal mission is to guarantee its citizens’ rights to liberty and property. Elections shall be held with all deliberate speed to compose the new Republican government.” – Proclamation of the Republic\n\nAfter Louis’s decree the Planteurs finally gained the strength to undo him. In an emergency session of the legislature two laws were passed : one annulling the Golden Law and another abolishing the Plantagenian monarchy and establishing a republic. Planteur Marechal Pierre de Maurras has been sworn in as the republic’s new president but it seems that the royal family has already fled..."

  dvg_plantagenia.9.t: "The Great Storm of 1837"
  dvg_plantagenia.9.d: "Nouvelle-Orleans is optimally situated in terms of commerce the natural trade hub of the Carribbean and southern Arcadia with a commanding position on the Mississippi River. Unfortunately it is also quite vulnerable to hurricanes the massive tropical storms which occasionally sweep into the Caribbean. "
  dvg_plantagenia.9.f: "Lying on a floodplain at the bottom of a coasetal valley Nouvelle-Orleans’ surrounding environs are essentially a giant bowl : if the levies on the river fail nothing stands in the way of its flooding. A few days ago a giant storm made landfall on the coast. With little time to react many Nouvelle-Orleaners were caught in the maelstrom of pounding rain and winds strong enough to embed splinters of wood in hardened cement! Our nation’s beautiful capital has been devastated and it will take months for all the damage to be repaired. To say nothing of the lives lost..."
  dvg_plantagenia.9.a: "The price we pay for living in Nouvelle-Orleans is steep"
 
  dvg_plantagenia.10.t: "Apaches Raid Saint Sauveur"
  dvg_plantagenia.10.d: "The Apaches are an especially ferocious tribe living on the western plains. Though they are too decentralized to launch organized conquests like the Inca of Ameriga they still possess the skill and coordination to conduct brutal attacks against the Plantagenian frontier."
  dvg_plantagenia.10.f: "This morning we received word that another Apache assault had occurred in the town of Saint Sauveur. It came at dusk just after the sun had set. Apache braves on horseback descended upon the town picking off lone Plantagenians and brutalizing the settlers who attempted to defend the area. It was only the timely intervention of a local frontier patrol which prevented them from pillaging the whole town though they still managed to escape. They inflicted severe damage and it will take months for Saint Sauveur to recover."
  dvg_plantagenia.10.a: "Damned Savages!"

  dvg_plantagenia.11.t: "Saint Sauver Raided Again!"
  dvg_plantagenia.11.d: "As the Apache raids persist on our western frontier, the question of where to distribute our forces has been raised."
  dvg_plantagenia.11.f: "In an act of astonishing temerity the Apache savages have attacked Saint Sauveur less than a month after their last incursion! This time the raid came just before dawn. While most townspeople were still asleep another horde of Apache braves rode straight into the town. Since the last raid many townspeople had acquired weapons and so were better prepared to fight. The result was street-by-street fighting between settlers and Apaches and the reduced amount of looting was balanced out by the increased bloodshed across the town. The incident has animated westerners against the tribes of the frontier and now western politicians are now calling on the government to take a stronger stance on the Apache threat and pacify the west. §RYet if we do so we would be moving away men and resources that might otherwise be allocated defending against the Belgians who seek to reclaim their lost southern lands..."
  dvg_plantagenia.11.a: "Send in more cavalry against the Apache."
  dvg_plantagenia.11.b: "We can't afford to divert troops away from the Belgian border."


  dvg_plantagenia.12.t: "A Royal Visit to La Galette"
  dvg_plantagenia.12.d: "King Louis I has recently been touring his new domain familiarizing himself with the land and its people while building popular support for the monarchy."
  dvg_plantagenia.12.f: "His recent stop in the growing town of La Galette however seems to have awakened something within the young monarch. While he had visited La Galette for the purpose of officially designating it as a royal city he has been enraptured by this “Gateway to the West.” He spent quite a bit of time inspecting the outlands of the region much to the shock of the locals and even conducted some of his tours while riding on horseback. All in all the frontier life seems to suit the “boy king” quite well..."
  dvg_plantagenia.12.a: "How gauche!"

  dvg_plantagenia.13.t: "Lord of the Plains"
  dvg_plantagenia.13.d: "Louis’ time in La Galette has affected him even more profoundly than had first been thought. In the weeks since the end of his national tour he has made several trips out to the frontier often upon his own horse"
  dvg_plantagenia.13.f: "Frontier towns and settlements across the plains have become accustomed to the sight of the king riding into town  his entourage scrambling to follow. Louis particularly enjoyed engaging in buffalo hunts with royal Indian auxiliaries to the point where his white minders were somewhat embarrassed by the familiar and fraternizing manner with which he treated them. Nouvelle-Orleans and the other cities of culture and refinement back west have been astonished by the king’s plebian activities but he has befriended quite a few influential politicians and family patriarchs in the region. What’s more the image of the dashing young “Roi-Vacher” riding across the plains with the same attire and attitude as the other frontiersmen is quickly winning the hearts of the people of northwestern Plantagenia."
  dvg_plantagenia.13.a: ";A cowboy king what is this world coming to?"

  dvg_plantagenia.14.t: "The Planteur Aristocracy"
  dvg_plantagenia.14.d: "Every monarchy has a noble class which must be managed but the Plantagenian aristocracy wields tremendous power in comparison to the nobility of other nations."
  dvg_plantagenia.14.f: "Hailing from English and French bloodlines of the highest pedigre these men and women control enormous plantations employing hundreds of slaves. The conditions upon these fields are said by radical liberals to be utterly brutal dominated by torture and violence. The Planteurs however, swear up and down that they are the preservers of chivalry tending to their slaves with the benevolence of a parent. As codified in the Second Charter of 1814 the censitary vote system weighs the impact of slaveowners according to their slaves even though the slaves themselves cannot vote. This means that the upper house is completely dominated by Planteur interests and the lower house thoroughly influenced by them as well. Resentment is building against the Planteurs but at the moment their position is difficult to assail."
  dvg_plantagenia.14.a: "A toast to our lords and ladies."

  dvg_plantagenia.15.t: "The Knight of Saint Georges"
  dvg_plantagenia.15.d: "Sir Louis La Fayette de Saint Georges is a scion of a noble family which accompanied the Anglois Charles I to Arcadia. Unlike many mulattos he is technically legitimate as his father married his slave mother in secret. Sent to Europe for his studies he fought for the liberals in the Hungarian Revolution. The existence of “yellow” (mulatto) nobles has long irritated the Planteurs but Sir Saint-Georges is now spreading ideas of racial equality unheard of in Plantagenia..."
  dvg_plantagenia.15.f: "“It is not enough to say ‘I am a man.’ I am a man of noble blood white and black together noble not despite my African heritage but BECAUSE of it. I feel no shame in being a mulatto because there is none. Is a mulatto not a man and a brother? Shall you weigh the hearts of all yellow men bestowing rights upon one but not another because of an insufficient quantity of European blood? If a man of European paternity and noble birth can be denied freedom then no man in Plantagenia not even the richest master of enslaved negros is free.” "
  dvg_plantagenia.15.a: "All men were “created equal?” Sounds dangerous to me..."

  dvg_plantagenia.16.t: "The Loi Jaune and its Consequences"
  dvg_plantagenia.16.d: "Despite the best efforts of the Planteurs the frequency of racial intermixture between whites and blacks has given rise to a class of “yellow” or mulatto peoples within Plantagenia. Their existence has proved vexing to the traditional racial dichotomy of European whites above and blacks and natives below."
  dvg_plantagenia.16.f: "To maintain the Planteur power structure the Loi Jaune or “Yellow Law” has been on the books in Plantagenia for decades. The law sharply curtails the civil liberties of free mixed-race people despite a notable amount of them physically appearing to be just as white as any Planteur. Many mulattos are now agitating for the repeal of the Loi Jaune especially due to the influence of the Knight of Saint Georges who has made the repeal of the law his first political priority."
  dvg_plantagenia.16.a: "Could Plantagenia even survive a future without such protections?"
