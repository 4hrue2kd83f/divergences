 dvg_poland.1.t: "The Rzeczpospolita"
 dvg_poland.1.d: "The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth has been in decline since the 17th century."
 dvg_poland.1.f: "The crown of Poland and Lithuania was forced to give several concessions to the Szlachta over the centuries, making the elected King nothing more than a glorified puppet in the hands of the Magnates holding huge domains where serfdom still prevails. The Union between the crown of Poland and its Ruthenian and Lithuanian territories has weakened as the Hetmans and foreign powers influence the governors of these areas. Poland is not vulnerable to Revolution thanks to a relatively Liberal political situation but if the Magnates aren't kept in check it's hard to see what will happen to Poland..."
 dvg_poland.1.a: "Si Deus nobiscum, quis contra nos?"
 dvg_poland.2.t: "The Death of Maksymilian III"
 dvg_poland.2.d: "The King of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth is dead!"
 dvg_poland.2.f: "The King of the Commonwealth has died in Warsaw after 20 years of rule mostly marked by his inability to hold any power in his kingdom. All Sejms convened by Maksymilian III were defeated by the use of liberum veto (the right for any noble to oppose proposals of the Assembly) and the pervading influence of Scandinavia and Bohemia. Despite his political weakness he leaves a good memory to the citizens of Warsaw that have gathered in huge crowds for his funeral. Now the preparatory Sejm will convene to select candidates to his succession, with his son Stanislaw in good place to succeed him."
 dvg_poland.2.a: "Farewell, Maksymilian!"
 dvg_poland.3.t: "The Sejm in Deadlock"
 dvg_poland.3.d: "The preparatory Sejm has been stalled by the lack of definitive list of royal candidates."
 dvg_poland.3.f: "The Sejm has been convened for several months already and has not been able to advance a definitive list of candidates to the succession of Maksymilian III. The main problem resides in the candidacy of his son Stanislaw, a well-known Liberal and independent noble which is seen as a threat by both the foreign powers of Scandinavia and Bohemia but also by the most powerful Magnates of the country who fear that Stanislaw will try to rescind their privileges. The liberation of his serfs in his own domain in 1833 was already widely criticized by the Magnateria while giving Stanislaw widespread popularity outside of the nobility."
 dvg_poland.3.a: "Will they be able to elect someone already?"
 dvg_poland.4.t: "The Black Procession"
 dvg_poland.4.d: "The burghers have gathered in Warsaw, demanding rights and the royal election to be hastened."
 dvg_poland.4.f: "Following the deadlock of the preparatory Sejm, several prominent members of the Polish bourgeoisie (including delegates from Kiev, Danzig or Vilnius) gathered in the streets of Warsaw to hasten the process and demanding more rights for the people not belonging to the nobility. The burghers had been protesting the difference of treatment for years but it was the first time such an event was organized. While the mayor of Warsaw, Michał Konopka, was officially the main organizer of the march, it is widely understood that this was coordinated by Stanislaw von Habsburg to strengthen his partisans in the Sejm. While completely pacific, going against Stanislaw could prove to provoke troubles with the Liberal movements."
 dvg_poland.4.a: "The 'people' are manipulated!"
 dvg_poland.5.t: "The East Withdraws"
 dvg_poland.5.d: "The Commonwealth's influence in Smolensk, Moldavia and the Cossack hosts has waned."
 dvg_poland.5.f: "The inability for the Commonwealth to manage the problems in Smolensk and Moldavia has led to a complete loss of influence in the East. Many Cossack hosts were loyal to Maksymilian personally, not to the Commonwealth at large, and his death has caused our influence over the Wild Fields to wither. The Cossacks in years past would regularly report to the Registry, so that the details of the Cossack Hosts could be tracked and their loyalties reaffirmed. Now the Cossacks have stopped reporting to the Registry, with all of the hosts once loyal to Warsaw turning away to focus on their own affairs. Were we in a stronger position, we might be able to launch punitive expeditions to force them back into line. Alas, the Sejm is so hopelessly divided, mired in petty squabbles and fearful of risking any resources on foreign adventures, that no such mission can be executed. All we can do is watch as the east returns to savagery, and hope that one day, we may tame it for good."
 dvg_poland.5.a: "We will return in time."
 dvg_poland.6.t: "Choosing the Royal Candidate"
 dvg_poland.6.d: "After harsh debates, the final list of candidates for the Polish-Lithuanian crown has been assembled."
 dvg_poland.6.f: "Despite the news of the loss of the allegiance of the Cossack hosts, the principalities of Smolensk and Moldavia, the Sejm continued to be deadlocked. Eventually the Sejm would have to choose the candidates for the election. After weeks of debates four candidates demarked themselves: Franz von Schwarzenberg, a cadet of one of the greatest Bohemian nobilities. Johannes von Wettin, cousin of the Duke of Prussia, supported by Scandinavians. Sigismund von Wittelsbach, a neutral German prince that is amenable to much of the factions. And finally the Sejm must decide if Stanislaw von Habsburg is to be put into the list or not."
 dvg_poland.6.a: "Stanislaw is on the list, he cannot be elected anyway."
 dvg_poland.6.b: "Refuse him, we can't be sure enough."
 dvg_poland.7.t: "The Royal election of $YEAR$"
 dvg_poland.7.d: "Stanislaw von Habsburg wins the Royal Election by a landslide."
 dvg_poland.7.f: "The Royal Election saw one of the greatest gatherings of the Szlachta in the history of the Commonwealth. Eventually, there wasn't much chance for the other candidates, as Stanislaw von Habsburg has gathered the majority of the votes, having worked on his public image for years."
 dvg_poland.7.a: "The Sejm"
 dvg_poland.7.b: "has chosen"
 dvg_poland.7.c: "Stanislaw"
 dvg_poland.7.d: "as King"

 je_golden_liberty:0 "Golden Liberty"
 je_eastern_resistance:0 "The Eastern Troubles"
 je_golden_liberty_reason: "The Szlachta has dominated our politics for centuries and they still make a very important part of our politics, but what was once called The Golden Liberty which made Commonwealth a beacon of tolerance and freedom now drags us down like an iron chain, preventing our state from modernizing, to cure our ills we must either curtail Szlachta's privileges or appease them by cementing their position."
 je_eastern_resistance_reason: "The vast swaths of land that make up our eastern holdings have been largely neglected for the most part of our history and what once made up The Great Kyivan Rus now is place of constant Tatar raids and exploitative serfdom of The Szlachta, if we don't end their plight and allow them to flourish within our borders, they eventually will rise up and take the matter into their own hands, which will mean the end of The Commonwealth."
