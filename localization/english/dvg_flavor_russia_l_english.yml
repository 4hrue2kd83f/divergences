  je_unite_muscovy:0 "Unite Central Russia"
  je_unite_muscovy_reason:0 "Since the defeat of Muscovy in the XVth century, the lands of Central Russia have been divided between various princedoms who were continuously manipulated by foreign powers for their own gain. If we want to unite Russia, we must first unite the lands of Muscovy and its honorable people to then strike at those who have humiliated our motherland for centuries! Moskoviya, vperyod!"
  united_muscovy: "Unite central Russia under one nation."
  je_mus_southern_expansion:0 "Southern Expansion"
  je_mus_southern_expansion_reason:0 "The South was always caught in a chaotic swirl that did not characterize our homeland in central Russia. The South is a diverse and wild land. With our newly found unity, the South appears less threatening each day, and conquering and taming it may bear fruit for our nation. We should expect a struggle, but Russians march towards the Black Sea is inevitable, for the land belongs to holy Russia alone!"
  je_mus_northern_expansion:0 "Northern Expansion"
  je_mus_northern_expansion_reason:0 "Novgorod stood as an abomination in our eyes for a long time, with a government of a mangled republic combined with a corrupt principality. Serving as the lap dogs of Scandinavia has not given Novgorod the prosperity and power to block our rightful path for the restoration and unification of the Russian lands. As our holdings in central Russia crystalize, we can finally march north and knock the arrogant merchants of Novgorod off their throne, and take it for ourselves and for all of Russia."

  je_rus_green_prince_nzh_reason:0 "The succession of the Principality of Nizhny Novgorod is one of the great questions agitating central Russia. The current prince, Alexey, is the brother-in-law of the Prince of Moscow through his wife and cousin of the prince of Yaroslavl. Having produced no offspring despite his decade of marriage, both hope to inherit the principality. A pamphlet has begun circulating throughout Russia, mocking the frivolous habits of Alexey "the Green Prince" and his love for figurative and performing arts. Although no explicit claims were made, this pamphlet infers that the Prince is a homosexual and thus unfit to rule his city. Alexey is said to have wept at the circulation of 'The Green Prince' and decided to retire to his dacha in the countryside with his artistic court while leaving the affairs of state to his wife and counts Balakhnin and Varankin."

  dvg_green_prince_events.1.d:0 "The succession of Nizhny Novgorod is secured."
  dvg_green_prince_events.1.f:0 "After a time of self-exile in his lavish dacha, Prince Alexey has emerged to announce that his wife is pregnant with an heir. In order to relieve his melancholy caused by the attacks of politicians and the pressures of his natural family and in-law-family, Alexey had delegated all political affairs to Anna Lyapunova, with whom he had an undeniable close and affectionate relationship. This announcement at the end of a routine long stay of the princess at the dacha has shocked the Russian courts, many speculating that the presumptive heir would actually be a legitimised child of the Princess and her latest publicly known paramour. Yet after a slightly premature childbirth, the child was declared the sole legitimate heir to Nizhny Novgorod."

  dvg_green_prince_events.2.f:0 "After self-exile in his lavish dacha, the cousin of our prince, Alexey of Nizhny Novgorod has emerged back to Nizhny Novgorod to present his heir to the crowds. This is a surprise to many in Russia, as his wife, Anna of Moscow, had not visited him for a long time before her current stay in the countryside dacha of the prince and is suspected to entertain many paramours. The heir being a Belsky seems hard to believe, and we would have the right to denounce the child as illegitimate to claim the principality that was ours but a few decades ago. But should Moscow support the princess and recognize her offspring as legitimate, we might lose the influence we have in the court."

Fortunately, the army has come to the princess aid and refused to make any moves against her. The situation does not remain under control for long, a few weeks later Prince Alexy suddenly collapses during dinner with Anna and his entourage, he spends the next days under intense medical care before finally dying. Nizhny Novgorod swirls up in chaos as the bickering factions of the Duma begin to accuse one another of assassinating the prince. Some accuse the princess, while some accuse the Yaroslavl faction."
