  dvg_saxony.10.t:0 "The Braunschweig Crisis"
  dvg_saxony.10.d:0 "The Duke of Braunschweig is quite hated by his subjects for his dubious personal choices."
  dvg_saxony.10.f:0 "The Duke has praised the Thuringian model of decentralization though his court is filled with Scandinavian advisors who would prefer his distant relative and heir, our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName], take over his estates. Now the plotters have finally struck - The Duke was taken unaware in the early morning while still in his bed, forced to abdicate and to flee abroad. We are thus the leading candidate to assume control over Braunschweig."
  dvg_saxony.10.a:0 "We will annex them!"
