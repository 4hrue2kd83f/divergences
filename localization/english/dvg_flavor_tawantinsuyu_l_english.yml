 seizing_collasuyu.1.t: "Settling the Collasuyan Ranges"
 seizing_collasuyu.1.d: "We have completed our long campaign to secure the ranges for our nation. Settlers are beginning to seek out promising sites from which to establish new towns and exploit the region's natural resources."
 seizing_collasuyu.1.f: "The Mapuche fought long and hard for centuries to protect their lands from us. Now at last they are defeated, and the lands of Collasuyu are indisputably ours. Now we must set ourselves to the task of populating and governing what we have won."
 seizing_collasuyu.1.a: "Collasuyu is ours, only the cone remains!"
 
 dvg_inca_ameriga.1.t: "The New Neighbor In The West"
 dvg_inca_ameriga.1.d: "The Empire of the Inca has recently inflicted a cataclysmic defeat upon the Beornians and reduced them to the region of Avalon. We now find ourselves at the doorstep of a resurgent expansionist power which no doubt has designs upon our lands as well."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.1.f: "Beornian refugees are already fleeing across the border telling tales of being driven from their homes by the Inca and now the Anglo-Lotharian population is demanding that we take revenge and destroy the “Inca menace” before they destroy us. Attempting to take down such an imposing empire would be a Herculean task so we must carefully consider if it might not be better to seek some type of lasting arrangement with Tawantinsuyu."
 
 dvg_inca_ameriga.1.a: "Beornia was and will be Lotharian, and Lotharian only!"
 dvg_inca_ameriga.1.b: "Let's arrange a coalition."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.1.c: "On second thought, let's opt for a diplomatic arrangement instead."

 dvg_inca_ameriga.2.t: "An Anti-Inca Coalition?"
 dvg_inca_ameriga.2.d: "Following our conquest of Beornia, Lotharingia has pledged to liberate its former ally by bringing together a coalition of Amerigan nations against us."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.2.f: "The Knights of Albion have become the figureheads of anti-Incanism across eastern Ameriga. Spreading tales of Inca atrocities and dire warnings about Tawantinsuyu's expansionist aims and its belligerent leader, Sapa Inka Washkar they have stoked the flames of fear into an inferno. As the most extant victim of Inca aggression, we have agreed to host a diplomatic conference in Grand Rivière in cooperation with the Knights to organize a grand coalition against the “enemy of peace and Amerigan freedom known as the Inka Empire.” Invitations are going out across southern Ameriga and even some European powers are considering to send delegates. This could be the greatest war Ameriga has ever seen."
 
 dvg_inca_ameriga.2.a: "The hour of our revenge draws near..."

 dvg_inca_ameriga.3.t: "Invitation to the Grand Riviere Conference"
 dvg_inca_ameriga.3.d: "Following our conquest of Beornia, Lotharingia has pledged to liberate its former ally by bringing together a coalition of Amerigan nations against the Inca."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.3.f: "The Knights of Albion have become the figureheads of anti-Incanism across eastern Ameriga. Spreading tales of Inca atrocities and dire warnings about Tawantinsuyu's expansionist aims and its belligerent leader, Sapa Inka Washkar they have stoked the flames of fear into an inferno.

 dvg_inca_ameriga.3.a: "We shall slay the Inka Beast!"
 dvg_inca_ameriga.3.b: "What, me worry?"

 dvg_inca_ameriga.4.t: "The Great Amerigan War"
 dvg_inca_ameriga.4.d: "The contracting Powers declare together that they regard the actual situation of Amerigan territorial integrity as a matter of communal interest for the nations of both Europe and Ameriga."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.4.f: "Animated by this interest they resolve to seek the most efficacious means for the restoration in utmost haste of the foundations of peace suiting to the rights of the nations and favorable to the well-being of the Inca. Thus the Powers are determined to act promptly and unanimously with the forces necessary for realizing this goal.” – Declaration of Grand Rivière \n \n Since the first clash between the Inca and the Spanish Empires, Tawantinsuyu has struggled against the foreigners. Now the newest chapter in that struggle is about to be written with the blood of thousands of Amerigans. An international coalition has assembled to dismantle the realm of Sapa Inca Washkar while he seeks to make himself master of the continent. The fate of Ameriga shall be decided upon the battlefield."
 
 dvg_inca_ameriga.4.a: "The future of Ameriga belongs to the Sapa Inca!"
