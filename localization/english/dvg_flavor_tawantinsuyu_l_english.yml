 seizing_collasuyu.1.f: "The Mapuche fought long and hard for centuries to protect their lands from us. Now at last they are defeated, and the lands of Collasuyu are indisputably ours. Now we must set ourselves to the task of populating and governing what we have won."

 dvg_inca_ameriga.1.t: "The New Neighbor In The West"
 dvg_inca_ameriga.1.d: "The Empire of the Inca has recently inflicted a cataclysmic defeat upon the Beornians and reduced them to the region of Avalon. We now find ourselves at the doorstep of a resurgent expansionist power which no doubt has designs upon our lands as well."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.1.f: "Beornian refugees are already fleeing across the border telling tales of being driven from their homes by the Inca and now the Anglo-Lotharian population is demanding that we take revenge and destroy the “Inca menace” before they destroy us. Attempting to take down such an imposing empire would be a Herculean task so we must carefully consider if it might not be better to seek some type of lasting arrangement with Tawantinsuyu."
 
 dvg_inca_ameriga.1.a: "Beornia was and will be Lotharian!"
 dvg_inca_ameriga.1.b: "We cannot risk the ire of Beornia!"
