 #dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.1.f:0 "While officially only loaned to the Spanish, in practice our capital of Cuzco has been occupied by the foreign invader for decades. With the weakening of the Spaniards in our North, we now have the opportunity to reclaim it."
 #dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.1.a:0 "We must reclaim our seat of power"

 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.3.d:0 "Divergences"
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.3.f:0 "We now hold ourselves a mighty empire, reforged out of the pathetic Spanish division." #There are those among us who ask us to push the barbarians out completely, but others advise caution, that we should instead seek to be equal to them.
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.3.a:0 "Our Empire's might will make us an equal to their great powers."

 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.4.d:0 "Not All is Lost"
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.4.f:0 "Despite Chinchasuyu being taken from us, we have not yet lost all. The Andino remain a great threat to Cuzco and hold our rightful land. We may be beaten back, but we have not lost! As a start, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] has marched south to subjugate the Mapuche who get in our way of territorial expansion."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.4.a:0 "Onwards!"

 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.5.t:0 "The Succession of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName]"
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.5.d:0 "Sustaining injuries in the recent war against the Mapuche, it seems the end of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName]'s rule is imminent. However, the question has arisen on who the successor should be."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.5.f:0 "Currently, it is disputed between the imperialist [SCOPE.sCharacter('leader_washkar_inka').GetFullName] as opposed to his brother, the diplomatic [SCOPE.sCharacter('leader_llapa_yupanki_inka').GetFullName]. \n \n [SCOPE.sCharacter('leader_washkar_inka').GetFirstName] is a military expert and the eldest son of the Sapa Inca is respected by the nobility for avenging the Rape of Cusco and punishing the Granadans and their Andino allies but he is also belligerent and prone to extreme actions. In contrast [SCOPE.sCharacter('leader_llapa_yupanki_inka').GetFullName], while technically not first in line according to Inca law, was viewed more favorably by his father and is a keen diplomat and administrator yet his non-confrontational style is disdained by many nobles who dismiss him as a coward. Both men have now laid claim to the throne. Whomever is not soon acclaimed as the new Sapa Inca will surely turn to his supporters to escalate the power struggle into something even more serious. Which prince shall take the reins of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]?"
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.5.a:0 "Favor [SCOPE.sCharacter('leader_llapa_yupanki_inka').GetFirstName]"
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.5.b:0 "Favor [SCOPE.sCharacter('leader_washkar_inka').GetFirstName]"

 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.6.t:0 "The Triumph of Llapa Yupanki Inca"
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.6.d:0 "Llapa's careful preparations guided his faction to victory enabling them to outfox the Washkar loyalists and sometimes disarm them before they could even take to the field."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.6.f:0 "Much of the aristocracy still saw violent division over the matter of succession but overall  the conflicts between Washkar and Llapa's supporters have been less intense than most had feared. With Llapa coronated Sapa Inca in an ornate ceremony. Many hope that his modernizing vision will bring Tawantinsuyu prosperity without excessive bloodshed."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.6.a:0 "Llapa shall lead us into the future!"
 
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.7.t:0 "Victory for Washkar Inca"
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.7.d:0 "What he believed would be a quick and simple conflict instead turned into a fierce fight which raged across the imperial heartland. Even where their main armies did not clash, the struggle among the polarized aristocracy has shaken and bloodied the empire."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.7.f:0 "Though Washkar has finally been coronated Sapa Inca in an ornate ceremony much of the country still bears deep wounds. Still with Washkar coronated Sapa Inca in an ornate ceremony many hope that his bold vision will bring Tawantinsuyu the vengeance which shall heal its wounds and sorrow.""
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.7.a:0 "Whatever happens, Inti shall guide us and Washkar shall lead us!"
  
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.8.t:0 "Sapa Inka Injured"
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.8.d:0 "As the Sapa Inka personally led the charge ont our territory, our archers hiding in the mountains have managed to ambush him."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.8.f:0 "Thanks to this, we can force the Incas to negotiate a white peace."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.8.a:0 "This is really the only possible way for us to stay independent."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.8.b:0 "No! We want to continue a fair fight even if we cannot win!"

 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.9.t:0 "The Death of Sapa Inka Washkar"
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.9.d:0 "For weeks, imperial doctors begged Sapa Inka Washkar to allow them to examine him, fearing he had been either infected or poisoned. Yet Washkar refused, asserting he would overcome his sickness through strength of will, even as he gradually lost his voice."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.9.f:0 "This evening, Washkar finally expired roughly an hour after sunset. This marks the second death of a Sapa Inka in less than thirty years, a terrible situation for Tawantinsuyu. In theory, Prince Tupac Wallqu, Washkar's son, will succeed him. Yet the powerful Amachaq of the empire may have other plans, as the prince is young and unsure of himself. As regent Mikolaj Kościuszko consolidates his position in Cuzco and his rivals make plans in the hinterlands, it appears that Washkar's Alexandrine triumph will give way to the wars of the Andine Diadochi.
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.9.a:0 "To the strongest!"

 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.10.t:0 "The Four Corners Reunited"
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.10.d:0 "Through shrewd negotiations and rapid political maneuvering, the Amachaq have managed to reunify the realm peacefully. The reign of young prince Túpac is set to begin on a positive note, and great change awaits the Empire."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.10.f:0 "Though their visions for the future of the empire greatly differed, the Amachaq were able to put their differences aside for the sake of peace, establishing a system of compromises and measured reform. During the regency of the Amachaq Kościuszko, a preliminary constituion was drafted, establishing measures through which the Tawantinsuyu will expand its efforts in the establishment of industry, diplomacy, cultural integration and human rights. All of this ensures a bright future for the great Empire of the Inka, master of the continent.
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.10.a:0 "Washkar's legacy is secured!"

 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.11.t:0 "Triumph of Roq'a Waqaq Inka"
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.11.d:0 "With months having gone by without the Amachaq being able to come to a consensus, Cuzco was subject to a palace coup by the hardliner bureaucrat Roq'a Waqaq. Having assassinated both young prince Tupac and his retainer, Roq'a now seizes the imperial throne for himself."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.11.f:0 "A staunch defender of the old ways of the Inka, Roq'a has denounced the Amachaq as savage barbarians and proclaimed himself the true son of Inti. With war threatening to tear apart the four corners, and whispers of revanchism among the Euro-Amerigans, no one knows what the future holds for the beleaguered children of Wiraqucha."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.11.a:0 "Inti save us all!"
