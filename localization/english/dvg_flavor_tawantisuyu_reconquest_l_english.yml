 #Misnumbered Llapa Event
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.2.t:0 "The Travels of Llapa Yupanki"
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.2.d:0 "With his reforms in place and the matter of succession settled, Sapa Inka Llapa can finally fulfill his long-held desire to travel the world! While he is gone, his sacred wawqi 'brother', a golden statue representing the other half of his camaquen (life force) will act in his place as ruler of the empire."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.2.f:0 "Though he is interested in touring the great cities and geographic marvels of Europe, the largest portion of his trip is dedicated to a lengthy stay in Japan. Despite this, he is known to harbor a long-standing desire to visit the Kingdom of Burgundy, which, alongside being Tawantinsuyu's most important economic and cultural partner in Europe, is also home to the infamous King Jean de Bouillon, with whom Llapa has exchanged a great deal of correspondence. Along the way, he will also meet with a variety of government officials in an effort to furnish Tawantinsuyu's international image."

 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.3.t:0 "Divergences"
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.3.d:0 "With the subjugation of the unruly Mapuche in the south and the reclamation of our rightful lands in the north, we have managed to stabilize our borders and reassert ourselves as the rightful rulers of the four corners."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.3.f:0 "We now hold ourselves a mighty empire, reforged out of the pathetic Spanish division. Even then, the last centuries have radically altered the demographic and cultural fabric of the continent surrounding us. Not only are our lands in the north now populated by several foreign ethnic groups, many of which spread ideologies and religions anathema to our righteous way of life, but the Euro-Amerigan barbarians in the east still hold our realm in disdain and will surely seek to dismantle us. All in all, the future remains uncertain for the Tawantinsuyu, though we may still bask in the glory of the great victory." 
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.3.a:0 "Our Empire's might will make us an equal to their great powers."

 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.4.d:0 "Not All Is Lost!"
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.4.f:0 "Despite Chinchasuyu being taken from us, we have not yet lost all. Still, the Quitenese barbarians remain a great threat to Cuzco and defile our rightful land. We may be beaten back, but we have not lost! However, before we may recover our lands in the north, we must first secure our vulnerable southern border. To this aim, the mighty [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] has marched south to subjugate the Mapuche who get in the way of our territorial expansion."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.4.a:0 "Onwards!"

 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.5.t:0 "The Succession of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName]"
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.5.d:0 "Sustaining grave injuries in the recent war against the Mapuche, it seems the end of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName]'s rule is imminent. However, the question has arisen on who the successor should be."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.5.f:0 "Currently, it is disputed between the imperialist [SCOPE.sCharacter('leader_washkar_inka').GetFullName], in opposition to his brother, the diplomatic [SCOPE.sCharacter('leader_llapa_yupanki_inka').GetFullName]. \n \n[SCOPE.sCharacter('leader_washkar_inka').GetFirstName] is a military expert and the eldest son of the Sapa Inka, respected by the nobility for avenging the Siege of Cuzco and punishing the Granadan barbarians, though he is also belligerent and prone to extreme actions. In contrast, [SCOPE.sCharacter('leader_llapa_yupanki_inka').GetFullName], while technically not first in line according to Inka law, was viewed more favorably by his father and is a keen diplomat and administrator, though his non-confrontational style is unappealing to many nobles who dismiss him as a coward. Both men have now laid claim to the throne. Whomever is not soon acclaimed as the new Sapa Inka will surely turn to his supporters to escalate the power struggle into something even more serious. Which prince shall take the reins of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]?"

 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.6.d:0 "Llapa's careful preparations guided his faction to victory, enabling them to outfox Washkar and his loyalists, disarming them before they could even take to the field."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.6.f:0 "Much of the aristocracy still saw violent division over the matter of succession, but overall the conflicts between Washkar and Llapa's supporters have been less intense than most had feared. With Llapa coronated Sapa Inka in an ornate ceremony, many hope that his modernizing vision will bring Tawantinsuyu prosperity without excessive bloodshed."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.6.a:0 "Llapa shall lead us into the future!"
 
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.7.t:0 "Victory for Washkar Inka"
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.7.d:0 "What he believed would be a quick and simple conflict instead turned into a fierce fight which raged across the imperial heartland. Even where their main armies did not clash, the struggle among the polarized aristocracy has shaken and bloodied the empire."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.7.f:0 "Though Washkar has finally seized the throne much of the country still bears deep wounds. Still, with Washkar coronated Sapa Inka in an ornate ceremony many hope that his bold vision will bring Tawantinsuyu the power to heal its sorrow and exert its might over the four corners."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.7.a:0 "Whatever happens, Inti shall guide us and Washkar shall lead us!"

 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.8.d:0 "As the Sapa Inka personally led the charge into our territory, our archers hiding in the mountains have managed to ambush him."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.8.f:0 "Thanks to this, we can force the Inka to negotiate a white peace."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.8.a:0 "This is really the only possible way for us to stay independent."

 #Washkar Succession Events
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.9.t:0 "The Death of Sapa Inka Washkar"
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.9.d:0 "For weeks, imperial doctors begged Sapa Inka Washkar to allow them to examine him, fearing he had been either infected or poisoned. Yet Washkar refused, asserting he would overcome his sickness through strength of will, even as he gradually lost his voice."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.9.f:0 "This evening, Washkar finally expired roughly an hour after sunset. This marks the second death of a Sapa Inka in less than thirty years, a terrible situation for Tawantinsuyu. In theory, Prince Tupac Wallqu, Washkar's son, will succeed him. Yet the powerful Amachaq of the empire may have other plans, as the prince is young and unsure of himself. As regent Mikolaj Kościuszko consolidates his position in Cuzco and his rivals make plans in the hinterlands, it appears that Washkar's Alexandrine triumph will give way to the wars of the Andine Diadochi.
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.9.a:0 "To the strongest!"

 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.10.t:0 "The Four Corners Reunited"
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.10.d:0 "Through shrewd negotiations and rapid political maneuvering, the Amachaq have managed to reunify the realm peacefully. The reign of young prince Túpac is set to begin on a positive note, and great change awaits the Empire."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.10.f:0 "Though their visions for the future of the empire greatly differed, the Amachaq were able to put their differences aside for the sake of peace, establishing a system of compromises and measured reform. During the regency of the Amachaq Kościuszko, a preliminary constituion was drafted, establishing measures through which the Tawantinsuyu will expand its efforts in the establishment of industry, diplomacy, cultural integration and human rights. All of this ensures a bright future for the great Empire of the Inka, master of the continent.
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.10.a:0 "Washkar's legacy is secured!"

 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.11.t:0 "A Coup in Cuzco"
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.11.d:0 "With months having gone by without the Amachaq being able to come to a consensus, Cuzco was subject to a palace coup by the hardliner bureaucrat Roq'a Waqaq. Having assassinated both young prince Tupac and his retainer, Roq'a now seizes the imperial throne for himself."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.11.f:0 "A staunch defender of the old ways of the Inka, Roq'a has denounced the Amachaq as savage barbarians and proclaimed himself the true son of Inti. With war threatening to tear apart the four corners, and whispers of revanchism among the Euro-Amerigans, no one knows what the future holds for the beleaguered children of Wiraqucha."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.11.a:0 "Inti save us all!"

 #Llapa Reforms Events
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.12.t:0 "The Young Sayri Rimaq"
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.12.d:0 "Dissent in the empire is heavily regulated and censored, but the Cuzco nobility is known to seldom express unusual ideas quite freely. In the last years, the government has kept track of a young prince from the Hurin Cuzco lineage, Sayri Rimaq, known to host meetings comprising distinguished amautas and foreign specialists, in which seditious topics are discussed."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.12.f:0 "Groomed to be an imperial administrator like all nobles from the capital, Sayri had free access to the knowledge stored in the Yachawasi, the Inkan House of Knowledge, and was also tutored by a Burgundian preceptor who acquainted him with the European classics. Sayri first gained renown with the publishing of a manuscript (written in the Burgundian language) outlining a proposed imperial constitution, but later retracted his work following pressure from his family, who see their son as a rebellious youth, fated to grow out of these ideas over time."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.12.a:0 "Quite a peculiar character"

 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.13.t:0 "The King and the Emperor"
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.13.d:0 "It was in Anvers that Llapa met the man he'd most looked forward to meeting during his time in Europe, King Jean de Bouillon of Burgundy. The two have exchanged letters in the past, and Jean is perhaps the only European who Llapa sees as even remotely comparable to himself."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.13.f:0 "Both Jean and the emperor's Inka retainers were astounded when Llapa — having studied the languages of Burgundy thoroughly in preparation for his visit — not only greeted him in Burgundian but carried on most of their conversation in that barbarian tongue! The two of them discussed rulership, their personal lives, the most beautiful places in Tawantinsuyu and Burgundy, and their distaste for Catholics. The Sapa Inka's knowledge of astronomy particularly impressed the Burgundian king. Jean then accompanied Llapa on a tour of Anvers, wrapping up the visit with a show of the internationally acclaimed royal gardens."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.13.a:0 "The Inka Puma and the Lion de Bourgogne go well together."
 
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.14.t:0 "Emperor of the Socialists"
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.14.d:0 "One of Sapa Inka Llapa's many titles is 'Lover and Benefactor of the Poor'. With the growth of socialist movements within the empire, Llapa sought to suppress them while simultaneously absorbing their power base. In the end, the co-opting of the moderate socialists' demands regarding welfare and labor rights has served to alienate the radical republicans, consolidating Llapa's rule."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.14.f:0 "Working with the rest of the royal court, a new law package has been drafted to introduce paternalistic welfare to Tawantinsuyu. The 'Beneficience Act' includes the curtailment of child labor, the creation of an expansive primary schooling system, and a generous pension available to both Ayllu and industrial workers guaranteeing retirement. Through framing the act in the language of 'traditional imperial benevolence', it has also included provisions to suppress and persecute those suspected of 'foreign ideology', and the newly-created secret police has already been dispatched to act against these dissidents."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.14.a:0 "A socialist subject of the empire is still a subject."

 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.15.t:0 "Proclamation of the Andean Republic"
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.15.d:0 "Over several years of absolute rule, Sapa Inka Llapa was forced to watch as his royal court, which he sought to make little more than a rubber stamp for his ambiitions, slowly turned against him. His flawed reform programme ended up alienating the Inka traditionalists while emboldening the radical republicans, who, under the leadership of Sayri Rimaq, seized power in Cuzco and forced Llapa to abdicate through force of arms."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.15.f:0 "As he was dragged away to house arrest in the imperial palace, Llapa wondered where he had gone wrong, and which foreign infiltrators were responsible for this hostile takeover. He blamed the lingering influence of the Amachaq, the Toledans and Chimu Catholics in the north, and even the Beornian raiders. Everyone but himself. Outside the window of his gilded cage, fireworks illuminated the grand city of Cuzco, now a bastion of republicanism, as agitated crowds raved and danced and argued in the streets. The Andean Republic is to be a new type of state, a synthesis between values of European socialism and traditional Ayni communitarianism and reciprocity. And Chancellor Sayri Rimaq is the boss of it all."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.15.a:0 "Long live the republic!"

 #Llapa Diplomatic Events
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.16.t:0 "The Sapa Inka Illuminates Europe"
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.16.d:0 "Sapa Inka Llapa has taken Europe by storm — in terms of popularity, that is. Crowds have gathered in Anvers, Paris, Copenhagen, and all the other great cities of the continent to behold the legendary Sapa Inka and his royal entourage."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.16.f:0 "European savages may be easily impressed, but the tremendous attention which Llapa and his officials received during their travels surprised even themselves. Whether riding a gondola in Venice, touring the fabulous gardens of Anvers, or cutting a sharp figure near St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, the Sapa Inka has caused more than a few Europeans to re-evaluate their views on Tawantinsuyu and the Inka."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.16.a:0 "They were starstruck!"

 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.17.t:0 "Twin Realms of the Sun"
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.17.d:0 "Over the past few days, the people of Japan have witnessed something extraordinary, the first-ever visit by an Inka Emperor! Sapa Inka Llapa Yupanki of Tawantinsuyu, as part of his diplomatic tour across Europe and the Pacific, recently concluded his visit to the Sunrise Kingdom."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.17.f:0 "The Sapa Inka surprised many with his good command of Japanese, though his excited fascination with Japanese art and culture was quite unconcealed. His reception in the imperial capital by the Emperor was quite noteworthy, a grand ceremony befitting the great rulers of the Pacific. Tawantinsuyu has long been a fixture in Japanese diplomatic and economic interchange, and this latest episode will only strengthen these bonds.'
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.17.a:0 "The performance of the geisha seems to have left quite an impression too..."

 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.18.t:0 "The Return of the Sapa Inka"
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.18.d:0 "After several months abroad, Sapa Inka Llapa has finally returned home to Tawantinsuyu. He was received in a magnificent ceremony, with him and the royal family traveling on a special train from the port city of Uraycusta all the way back to Cuzco."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.18.f:0 "The experience has humbled the Sapa Inca, giving him insights on the nations of the world and challenging his conceptions of their peoples. Moreover, the cultural exposure which his court officials received in places as diverse as Burgundy and Japan is sure to influence the political and social developments in the Tawantinsuyu."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.18.a:0 "Today, the world has grown smaller."

 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.19.t:0 "The Death of Llapa Yupanki Inka"
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.19.d:0 "The Sapa Inka had fought to keep healthy over the last decade. The stress of rulership was great, but his will even greater. During his last years, Llapa and his imperial biographer held regular sessions in which, through dictation and interview, the Sapa Inka composed his final review of his own life.
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.19.f:0 "Llapa expressed satisfaction at the reforms and modernization he brought about, but more importantly, in having cultivated an educated people who could inherit this prosperous realm. Llapa declared his memoirs finished last evening and went to sleep early. This morning it was discovered that he was not in his bed, and palace attendants searched the grounds. The Sapa Inka of modernity was found expired on the palace terrace, having awoken early and watched the sun rise over the mountains, his face an image of peace.
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.19.a:0 "All suns must one day set."

 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.20.t:0 "Lastahallpa"
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.20.d:0 "Since the discovery of the South Pole, our geographers and scientists have repeatedly expressed the value of establishing a claim to some section of Antarctica. Now, a new law has been passed to formally demarcate Lastahallpa, the 'Land of Snow', Tawantinsuyu’s newest southern territory."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.20.f:0 "While the value of the land itself is little beyond national prestige and scientific data gathering, the expansion of the Realm of the Four Parts to another continent is nevertheless a significant milestone in our national history."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.20.a:0 "Even in the frozen south, Inti’s light shines."

 #Amachaq Events
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.21.t:0 "The Three Amachaqs"
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.21.d:0 "Over the preceeding years, a number of unusual figures have been raised high into the halls of power in Cuzco as a result of their close friendship with Washkar Inka. Nicknamed the 'Amachaq', meaning 'law-maker', their presence has unnerved several of the more traditional nobles, something Llapa Yupanki has not left unnoticed in his bid for power. Washkar, on the other hand, seems unbothered by this, and is rumored to plot great plans with his military clique."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.21.f:0 "Admiral Nonaka Fujimori, the Noble from the West, was first sent to Tawantinsuyu as a diplomatic attaché from the Japanese Empire. Though he was at first delegated to a menial bureaucratic position, a series of passionate discussions on naval tactics and warfare endeared him to Washkar's eyes, who suddenly promoted the man to the role of primary organizer of the nascent Inkan Navy.\n \nAllqamari Samiri, the Great Condor, was the next arrival. Having been born to a minor noble family in a remote corner of the oft-neglected Qullasuyu, Samiri became a popular local leader, showing himself a competent administrator who managed to shield the traditional Ayllus of the region from the worst effects of the imperial enclosures and new monetary reforms. During one of Washkar's grand campaigns in the south, he noticed the unusual prosperity of the lands under Samiri's care. After a weekend of rest under the shade of the lush groves, Samiri was made Suyuyuc Apu of the entire Collasuyu, a position which he uses to argue for greater cultural integration and preservation efforts in the empire.\n \nAmilcar Cabral, the Black Panther, was the latest addition to the group. Once enslaved to a cruel Granadan master, Cabral led a group of fugitives and founded a modest palenque in the western reaches of the Amazon. Him and Washkar would meet when the latter had been separated from his troops during the counter-offensive to the Siege of Cuzco. Lost and exhausted, Washkar headed into the jungle in order to hunt to survive, but was instead gravely wounded by a vicious jaguar. The inhabitants of the palenque chased the beast off, and saved the unconscious prince by tending to his wounds. Experiencing a rapid recovery, Washkar and Cabral departed towards the Granadan border from which they led a raid on Cabral's former plantation, freeing several enslaved men and women and bringing them to safety in Cuzco. Cabral was promoted to the highest ranks of the Inkan Army, and is known to be leading a study group on a peculiar new ideology named 'Afro-Incaism'." 
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.21.a:0 "What a motley crew."

 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.22.t:0 "The Fourth Amachaq"
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.22.d:0 "’My acquaintances wonder why I have not returned to our Rzeczpospolita after all these years. But my friend, the emperor I serve is on par to the likes of Caesar and Alexander. He is truly a hero, a man greater than life, a paragon of rulership. Some may call him tyrant, but is it not tyrannical to let the serfs back home toil and die in poverty?’ - Letter to Stanislaw Habsburg"
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.22.f:0 "Mikolaj Kosciuszko’s fate is unusual. Born in 1805 to a Polish magnate, he grew up studying in Warsaw and Krakow, but then began a life of adventure. Fighting for liberty, he participated in the Hungarian Independence War and the Sicilian Revolution. However, his adventures were costly and left him debt-ridden. To escape the debts he left his old life and took a ship to Atlantia, where he heard stories about the Incan Empire, becoming fascinated. He traveled to Tawantinsuyu and presented himself as a military advisor. His worth was tested and proven in cavalry victories against José de Herrera and Llapa Yupanki. Impressed, Washkar made Mikolaj a permanent part of his inner circle, as well as the educator of his young heir, Prince Tupac."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.22.a:0 "Even the son of a Magnate recognises the Sapa Inka's glory!"

 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.23.t:0 "The Antisuyu Expedition"
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.23.d:0 "Antisuyu has risen in importance in recent years, with the empire claiming not just the Rupa-Rupa, the high jungle, as before, but rather all of the forest until the ocean. However, the cartography of the interior is notoriously archaic compared to the rest of the continent, something the new governor Kuara Tiarayu sought to change by commissioning a small scientific expedition. Upon hearing of this, Sapa Inka Washkar decided to personally lead the project."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.23.f:0 "For four weeks, the imperial retinue journeyed along the River Amassonas, surrounded on both sides by a great wall of dense foliage, until they arrived at the hidden village of Ploumanao. The locals, descended from Breton pirates, welcomed the group, having heard of the great Sapa Inka even in their isolated settlement. Washkar, while drunk, even decided to take part in a local Guren Contest, a traditional form of Breton wrestling in which the winners are awarded a sheep. Even though there are no sheep in the rainforest, the emperor liked his prize parrot so much he decided to grant the village a new privileged status as an 'free imperial city' in the suyu."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.23.a:0 "The depths of the jungle hold many secrets."

 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.24.t:0 "The Expedition to the End of the Qullasuyu"
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.24.d:0 "As Sapa Inka Washkar is aware, everything is finite and this extends even to the Realm of the Four Corners. Having never personally seen how far the southern reaches of his empire extend, the Sapa Inka summoned Amachaq Fujimori to plot a grand southern expedition, seeking a mythical territory known to Beornian explorers as the Land's End."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.24.f:0 "After a month-long trek Washkar reached the so-called Land’s End, really a meager collection of desolate islands, and at its southernmost point erected a shrine to Inti, establishing this site as the end of his empire. Still unsatisfied, the Sapa Inka gazed across the southern sea. Remembering tales from his youth of a vast southern land of ice and snow, he delved into the freezing waters and proclaimed that one day his descendants will explore the southern continent, and that it shall be their new frontier and one day become their Pichqasuyu, or fifth realm."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.24.a:0 "A fifth realm? Should we rename the country to Pichqantinsuyu?"

 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.25.t:0 "The Purge of the Amachaqs"
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.25.d:0 "Since Sapa Inka Llapa's ascent to power, and even with the death of Washkar Inka, the Amachaq have remained a thorn in the emperor's side. Strongly determined to pursue the agenda of their fallen leader, the Amachaq continue to exert great autonomy from Cuzco, running their territories as effective fiefdoms. In order for the Sapa Inka's grand plans to be enacted, they must be removed."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.25.f:0 "Our loyal Chasquis acted quickly and decisively, spreading to the four corners the imperial decree for the arrest of the 'foreign usurpers'. Even then, this was not quite enough. Fujimori was able to muster a mutiny in the Inkan pride of the fleet and sailed to asylum in Taiwan. Cabral, meanwhile, was nowhere to be found in the military headquarters, but a rumor among the barracks suggests he once again disappeared into the Amazon. Disconcertingly, many seem to believe he will one day return to claim the imperial throne. Only Samiri surrendered peacefully to the encroaching soldiers, though his status among the peasants of the Qullasuyu make him impossible to simply execute without triggering large-scale revolt. Instead, our negotiators have forced him to surrender the titles granted to him by the vile Washkar, and he has seemingly returned to his former life as a lowly Ayllu administrator."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.25.a:0 "None of them will escape Inti's gaze."

 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.26.t:0 "Formalizing Imperial Succession"
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.26.d:0 "Sapa Inka Llapa's reform programme has placed more power than ever in the hands of the Sapa Inka and his inner circle. Due to this, the royal court has sought a solution to the frequent succession disputes which have torn the empire apart in the past. Complicating matters is the question of potential female succession, as Llapa's firstborn is his daughter Llipya Sinchiyachiq Inka, and although the Qoya has always held an important role in governance, the Tawantinsuyu has never had a woman as head of state."
 dvg_tawantisuyu_reconquest.26.f:0 "The Qorimanta Kamachikuy, or 'Golden Law', is founded on a simple premise. The legitimate heir will have their ascension to the throne guaranteed by an elite military unit (nicknamed the 'Guardians of Inti') which answers directly to the Sapa Inka and whose authority is uncontestable under charges of heresy.\n \nDespite this, the imperial nobility has become split on how an heir is to be considered rightful. The so-called 'Cuzco faction', considered to be the closest in policy to Llapa himself, supports the ascension of Llipya, whom Llapa has always kept close to himself and educated personally. The traditionalists support Llapa's eldest son, Hurhi Sunquyuq Inka, who is known for his closeness to the religious establishment and his persecution of Catholics and Anglicans. Finally, Llapa's youngest son, Sinchi Churan Inka, known for his promotion of welfare and cultural integration, experiences greater popularity among the oft-ignored (but numerous) nobles of the Qullaw, who have thus proposed an elective system in which the heir is elected by the provincial governors."

 #Other 
 
 sapa_inka_notification:0 "The Sapa Inka of Tawantinsuyu has been captured and seriously injured in the war against the Wallmapu, forcing the Inkan army to retreat over the debate on succession."
 inca_annex_tahiti:0 "The Second Pacific Expedition"
 inca_annex_tahiti_desc:0 "Tales from the old empire tell how the great Inka Tupac Yupanki sailed across the Pacific, discovering the mythical islands of Nina-chumbi and Hahua-chumbi. With the expansion of our navy, we are once again able to exert power over the Southern Pacific."
 inca_language_reform:0 "Runaqelqasqa"
 inca_language_reform_desc:0 "Since its founding, Tawantinsuyu has not possessed an alphabet. Quipus, knotted cords used to register data such as tax records, historical records, messages and census information, have served us well but are tedious to reproduce. In addition, the coming of traders from Asia and Europe has led to the rise of several rudimentary phonetic languages, used for mercantile purposes. Seeking to standardise the imperial language, Sapa Inka Llapa assembled a team of imperial amautas and foreign experts to produce a universal script. A revolution in imperial literature and education is on the horizon!"
 inca_province_reform:0 "Proclaim the Hatun Kamachi"
 inca_province_reform_desc:0 "While each of the four corners of our realm have traditionally been divided into a fluctuating number of provinces, defined by population and the whims of local governors. Now, with the completion of the Iron Qhapaq Ñan, Sapa Inka Llapa has proposed a new imperial edict, reorganizing the subdivisions of the empire and the associated Imperial Guilds. This Great Law, or 'Hatun Kamachi', shall improve the state's administrative efficiency as well as the reach of our institutions, ensuring the entire empire is governed directly from Cuzco."
 inca_northern_claims:0 "Expand the Chinchasuyu"
 inca_northern_claims_desc:0 "Though the northern border of the empire has historically only reached as far as Quito, control over the Northern Andes is essential for our internal security and to curb the power of the Hispanic barbarians. Our imperial amautas have already come up with a variety of theories to support this claim, ranging from a 'natural border' of the Tawantinsuyu spreading across the entire mountain range, to a 'duty of protection' of the northern minorities (The Muisca, Guajiro, and the Africans) against Catholic oppression. Either way, this land will be ours."
 inca_eastern_claims:0 "Expand the Antisuyu"
 inca_eastern_claims_desc:0 "Over the centuries, few powers have been able to exert control over the depths of the Amazon rainforest. Still, our empire's brave scouts and messengers, the Chasquis, have established a deep network of connections with the local peoples, providing them with arms and resources to curb European encroachment. Should we bolster our presence in this region, we will be able to create a large and powerful buffer territory against Euro-Amerigan expansionism."
 inca_accept_afro_latino:0 "The Principles of Afro-Incaism"
 inca_accept_afro_latino_desc:0 "Upon our successful conquest of the north, we discovered the area had experienced great demographic turmoil under the barbarous rule of the Spaniards. While our initial plan was to exert control over this region with the aid of the robust Muisca and Guajira peoples, it is now apparent their population has dwindled too much to serve as effective collaborators. Instead, we will rely on the aid of the formerly-enslaved Africans, who are receptive to our rule and to cultural integration, and who have everything to lose should our empire crumble. In doing so, they will be elevated to the same status as the Quechua and Aimara subjects of the Tawantinsuyu. A new age of Afro-Incaism is upon us!"
