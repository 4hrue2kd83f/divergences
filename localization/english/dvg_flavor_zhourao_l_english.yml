 je_one_kongsi: "One Kongsi!"
 je_one_kongsi_reason: "The Country, Long Divided, Must Unite. Tensions between Mianjin and Yaluo have grown great, and mediation between the two has resulted in failure. The time has come for war, and of this war, there may be no winners, for brother will be against brother, and family against family once more."
 je_yaluo_reform: "Anger of Conservative Hui"
 je_yaluo_reform_reason: "The turn to democracy in Yaluo, away from the tyrannical oligarchy of Mianjin, might have been expected to be received universally well, however, those in the northern hui of Xinxiang are far more close to their relatives in Mianjin. Too much reform could lead them to rejoin Mianjin and break free."
 je_yaluo_reform_goal: "Anger of Conservative Hui"
 je_invade_zhusha: "Invade Zhusha!"
 je_invade_zhusha_reason: "Our northern brothers, whilst culturally different, worshipping a different religion, are still Zhourao. We must unify the Eastern Continent, unleashing a storm upon the North."
 je_red_sultan: "Red Sultan"
 je_red_sultan_reason: "The current sultan is old, and his sons, Ma Lushou, and Ma Luoxi already bite at eachothers throats, however, while Ma Zicheng still rules, their schemes are far more limited. Once the Red Sultan is out of the picture; chaos might very well overwhelm Zhusha, should a successor not emerge as dominant."
 je_red_prince: "Red Prince's War"
 je_red_prince_reason: "Ma Zicheng has collapsed! The chaos that has resulted leaves the two princes in bitter conflict, now unrestrained by their father, they both look to their allies, both abroad and at home, to take charge of the nation, lest it be lead into chaos by their brother!"

# je_frontier_wars: "The Frontier Wars"
# je_frontier_wars_reason: "Our recent renegation of our promises with the Hongshan tribes has led to those that were previously working with us turning against us. They have begun actively resisting our rule in the west, and are seeking the complete removal of our influence from the area!"
 
 #Events
 dvg_zhourao.1.t: "The Yaluo League"
 dvg_zhourao.1.d: "Yaluo is the youngest Zhourao state, with a recent origin after the First Kongsi war, wherein Yaluo fought for its independence and won. This has led to a relative period of peace in Zhourao, with the various powers interested in the area mostly agreeing to stay away from the continent. However, growing tensions between Mianjin and Yaluo might very well break the peace in the coming decade."
 dvg_zhourao.1.f: ""The key to success is action, and in action, it is necessary to persevere""
 dvg_zhourao.1.a: "With the help of our Hongshan allies, we can ensure our continued freedom"
 dvg_zhourao.2.t: "The Zongting"
 dvg_zhourao.2.d: "The Zongting, or Assembly Hall, is the parliament body of Yaluo. It is made up of delegates from our constituent Hui, whose members are mostly descended from original colonists from Qingqiu. They are unelected, and in recent times, the issue of membership lists in the Hui has come into debate. There are those who would open up the memberships greatly, even including some Hongshan amongst the lists, and others who would give membership only to those who fought for our independence."
 dvg_zhourao.2.f: "Qingqiu originally colonized the area that would become Zhourao, but the population of Qingqiu settlers was quickly outgrown by Chinese immigration."
 dvg_zhourao.2.a: "Maintain the status quo"
 dvg_zhourao.2.b: "Give membership to those who fought alongside us!"
 dvg_zhourao.2.l: "Open the membership lists to all working men!"
 dvg_zhourao.3.t: "Hongshan Tribute"
 dvg_zhourao.3.d: "During the Kongsi War, the Zongting sought allies amongst the Hongshan tribes spread throughout the interior. Many signed treaties of friendship with our people, fighting beside us against the oppressors in Wheizhou. Their support was not unconditional : The tribes were told that after the war they would receive their fair share of tribute from our gold mines. Now, with independence secured, the Hongshan are calling in the debt. A delegation of tribal chiefs from the Guli confederation have arrived in Qingshui requesting that the Zongting formally grant them a share of the gold profits from our mines. While some Hui have already been doing this, many of the Hui in the northeast have been refusing to pay them the promised tribute. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that since independence many lucrative mines and settlements have been established in the interior of Yaluo on traditional Hongshan land, with the tribesmen consenting on the basis that they would be given their share of the wealth"
 dvg_zhourao.3.f: "The Hongshan are still reviled as Hongshanman in our northern provinces"
 dvg_zhourao.3.a: "We owe nothing to these barbarians, prepare to crush them!"
 dvg_zhourao.3.b: "We can pay them a part of our treasury to appease both sides."
 dvg_zhourao.3.l: "We will force the northern Hui to pay tribute!"
 dvg_zhourao.4.t: "Scandinavia Wants to Operate Businesses in Yaluo"
 dvg_zhourao.4.d: "Scandinavian businessmen want to be allowed to operate inside of our territory. This would no doubt bring us some measure of wealth, as well as a benefit to our research. However, it would also enrage the more conservative Hui in our nation, who worry that this is merely a prelude to an outright invasion by Scandinavia."
 dvg_zhourao.4.f: "We should not provide the enemy an opportunity to defeat us"
 dvg_zhourao.4.a: "We will have no intervention by the West in Zhourao!"
 dvg_zhourao.4.b: "We will allow them a presence in our ports, nothing more."
 dvg_zhourao.4.c: "We are open to investment!"
 dvg_zhourao.5.t: "One Kongsi"
 dvg_zhourao.5.d: "The time has come in Zhourao, the reforms of Yaluo in recent years have put them on a different course from Mianjin, and as the two Kongsi expand west, tensions are on the rise. A second Kongsi war is on the cards."
 dvg_zhourao.5.f: ""War is politics with bloodshed""
 dvg_zhourao.5.a: "The truce is almost over, soon, we can take the war to our enemy. They, however, could too take the war to us."
 dvg_zhourao.6.t: "The Northern Hui Defect!"
 dvg_zhourao.6.d: "Dissatisfied with the reforms implemented by the Zongting, the more conservative Huis in the north have defected back to Mianjin!"
 dvg_zhourao.6.f: "A new beginning often is disguised as a painful ending"
 dvg_zhourao.6.a: "Oh dear"
 dvg_zhourao.7.t: "Militia Mobilize!"
 dvg_zhourao.7.d: "While the Northeastern Hui have abandoned us, the people have not! All across Yaluo, a surging tide of workingmen have taken up arms in defense of the League. Our reforms, which the nay-sayers insisted would weaken our unity, have convinced every man in Yaluo that the League is worth fighting and dying for. In Qingshui, thousands of men have come forward to enlist, some fresh off the boat from China. They are joined by a handful of European's adamant to prove their loyalty. The Hongshan tribes mobilize in the interior. In every town and settlement, the Hui have called upon every man on the lists. As one, Yaluo marches to war"
 dvg_zhourao.7.f: ""We swear by the League to stand truly by each other, and fight to defend our rights and liberties." - Yaluo militiamen's oath"
 dvg_zhourao.7.a: "Unity is strength!"
 dvg_zhourao.8.t: "Tensions in the North Ease Over"
 dvg_zhourao.8.d: "With the scope of our reforms not distancing ourselves too far from Mianjin, the conservative Huis have for the most part fallen in line"
 dvg_zhourao.8.f: "A good situation"
 dvg_zhourao.8.a: "A good sign, we can focus on the war with Mianjin"
 dvg_zhourao.9.t: "Yaluo Petitions us for our Annexation!"
 dvg_zhourao.9.d: "We have long had a beneficial relationship with Yaluo, the time has come that Yaluo is asking us to unify."
 dvg_zhourao.9.f: "As it should be."
 dvg_zhourao.9.a: "We refuse! We will make war on them instead!"
 dvg_zhourao.9.b: "We will join our brothers!"
 dvg_zhourao.10.t: "One Kongsi in Zhourao"
 dvg_zhourao.10.d: "With the unification of Mianjin and Yaluo, the time for a unified and strong Zhourao has come. We should look next to our north, attack the Red Sultans, and bring the Zhouraohui under our dominion, as they have so often tried to bring us under theirs."
 dvg_zhourao.10.f: "Unification, then stability, a nation must be formed of a heap of loose sand."
 dvg_zhourao.10.a: "This day will be remembered!"
 dvg_zhourao.11.t: "The Guli Accept!"
 dvg_zhourao.11.d: "The Guli confederation has accepted our request to integrate them! This is a glorious day for Yaluo, as our nation stretches now across all of the Yongding!"
 dvg_zhourao.11.f: "The Hongshan are an integral part of our nation."
 dvg_zhourao.11.a: "We will annex them right away"
 dvg_zhourao.12.t: "The Second Kongsi War"
 dvg_zhourao.12.d: "The First Kongsi war, fought between Yaluo and Mianjin, is still bitterly remembered in much of the older populace of our nation. It is now time for a second Kongsi war, this time, one that will be final."
 dvg_zhourao.12.f: "We can only end the conflict by winning."
 dvg_zhourao.12.a: "War is the only option now."
 dvg_zhourao.13.t: "The Second Kongsi War"
 dvg_zhourao.13.d: "The First Kongsi war, fought between Yaluo and Mianjin, is still bitterly remembered in much of the older populace of our nation. It is now time for a second Kongsi war, this time, one that will be final."
 dvg_zhourao.13.f: "We can only end the conflict by winning."
 dvg_zhourao.13.a: "War is the only option now."
 dvg_zhourao.14.t: "One Zhourao"
 dvg_zhourao.14.d: "With the unification of all three Zhourao polities, the nation is at last united. Centuries of invasion by the Red Sultans have been put to an end, with the final unification of Zhourao under a southern, non-Islamic polity."
 dvg_zhourao.14.f: "Now is the time for stability, as hungry European powers oncemore look towards the continent, we must fend them off as one."
 dvg_zhourao.14.a: "For now, the nation can breathe a sigh of relief."
 #Mianjin
 dvg_zhourao.501.t: "The Kamilaluoyi Conflict"
 dvg_zhourao.501.d: "With Europeans ever encroaching towards our land, we will ensure there is plenty of desert in between us and the Europeans. We shall demand the Hongshan tribes of our west bend the knee!"
 dvg_zhourao.501.f: "Hongshanman, or red barbarians from the mountains, is the name the Chinese settlers gave to the aboriginal tribes in the continent after initial contact. Over time, those friendly with the Aboriginals would drop the -man, or barbarian, and they would become just the Hongshan."
 dvg_zhourao.501.a: "Onwards!"
 dvg_zhourao.502.t: "Remain Catholic?"
 dvg_zhourao.502.d: "Whilst the elite of our country are still Catholic, recent movements in the Zongting have led to our religion being called into question. Without reform, we might end up in a situation where we face a revolt from the non-catholic Zhourao."
 dvg_zhourao.502.f: "God is with us, but we must honor our roots as well."
 dvg_zhourao.502.a: "Catholicism is the way forward, under god."
 dvg_zhourao.502.b: "We should return to more traditional religion, lest we find our houses stormed and our power wrested."
# dvg_zhourao.503.t: "Changyun in 1836"
# dvg_zhourao.503.d: "Changyun, the “island of the Long Cloud,” was discovered in the XVIIIth century by Mianjin traders on their way to Qingqiu. They managed to secure a treaty port on the North island during the Musket Wars that plagued the island after the same traders sold new weapons to the Maoli tribes. After the weakening of the tribes, the Mianjin kongsi established a permanent forum between the different iwi (confederations of tribes), so as to secure their control on the island, leading to the formation of the ‘United Tribes of Changyun’. However, this state barely exists beyond the Mianjin meeting place in Yongting. Furthemore, a popular Maoli rangatira (chief) named Tapua Te Rauangaanga is known to prefer Scandinavia to Mianjin and to be an avid military scholar. It is rumored that he entertains the idea of securing a kingdom over the whole island - and perhaps even expelling us in the process."
 #Zhusha
 dvg_zhourao.701.t: "The Southern Push"
 dvg_zhourao.701.d: "With the growth of European colonies in Zhourao, it has become a necessity to have a properly defined border. We have met with the Europeans, and agreed on a suitable border. Now it is only necessary to demand the tribes of the Hongshanman bend the knee to us."
 dvg_zhourao.701.f: "Hongshanman, or red barbarians from the mountains, is the name the Chinese settlers gave to the aboriginal tribes in the continent after initial contact. Over time, those friendly with the Aboriginals would drop the -man, or barbarian, and they would become just the Hongshan."
 dvg_zhourao.701.a: "It is our natural right."
 dvg_zhourao.702.t: "Yalai Raids"
 dvg_zhourao.702.d: "In recent years, skirmishes on the frontier have grown larger and larger, with a recent attack by Yalai forces, resisting our incursions into their native land, leading to the burning of a frontier outpost. The situation has proved a boiling point in the court of the Red Sultan, and it has been decided to punish the Yalai for their insolence. However, the two princes and their factions have begun to view the incedent as an opportunity to increase their power. They must pay, but who will take the sword to the Hongshanman?"
 dvg_zhourao.702.f: "Not only the men, but the women and the children too, slaughtered by barbarian Hongshan."
 dvg_zhourao.702.a: "We will make them suffer!"
 dvg_zhourao.702.b: "They must pay, Luoxi will lead our troops against them!"
 dvg_zhourao.702.c: "They must pay, Lushou will lead our troops against them!"
 dvg_zhourao.703.t: "The Red Sultan"
 dvg_zhourao.703.d: "Ma Zicheng has held the position of Red Sultan and Commander of the Faithful since his youth, but as he grows older, it is becoming increasingly evident that the winds of change have reached Zhusha. His two sons look to establish themselves as his heir, Ma Lushou looks to the Japanese, to join a growing sphere of pan-asian powers, and protect tradition. Ma Luoxi, however, looks to the Anglois, to westernize. Their plays for power threaten to split the country, as raids from Hongshanman become more and more frequent. On the Red Sultan's death, there will surely be great change in Zhusha."
 dvg_zhourao.703.f: "The two brothers, Lushou and Luoxi are constrained only by a shared reverance for their father."
 dvg_zhourao.703.a: "God willing, the country must unite!"
 dvg_zhourao.704.t: "Ma Zicheng Collapses!"
 dvg_zhourao.704.d: "Ma Zicheng has collapsed! Already powers are beginning to move to support their favoured prince, but the recent actions undertaken by the leading prince have caused a swift end to the conflict."
 dvg_zhourao.704.f: "The rule of the Red Sultans will continue in Zhusha, and soon, perhaps all of Zhourao."
 dvg_zhourao.704.a: "Ma Lushou secures power!"
 dvg_zhourao.704.b: "Ma Luoxi secures power!"
 dvg_zhourao.705.t: "The Red Princes War"
 dvg_zhourao.705.d: "Ma Zicheng has collapsed, and the fragile peace that had previously been held between Ma Lushou and Ma Luoxi has been broken, with the princes and their supporters now aiming to secure power, no matter the cost."
 dvg_zhourao.705.f: "For the good of the country, Alhamdulillah."
 dvg_zhourao.705.a: "A spark has ignited dense kindling, and the fate of Zhusha has been thrown now to the barrels of guns."
 
 dvg_zhourao.706.t: "Succession Crisis in Zhusha"
 dvg_zhourao.706.d1: "News from Zhusha has reached us, it seems that their Sultan has collapsed, which presents us an opportunity. We have been supporting the first prince, Ma Lushou, on account of his anti-western pro-Japanese standing, however, he has proven unable to secure power. He is now fighting the second prince, Ma Luoxi for the throne. It is in our interest to support Ma Lushou, to prepare the region to be aligned into the Japanese Sphere."
 dvg_zhourao.706.d2: "News from Zhusha has reached us, it seems that their Sultan has collapsed, which presents us an opportunity. The first prince, Ma Lushou is fervently anti western, and is vehemently against our interests in the region. The second prince, however, Ma Luoxi, has proven more pliable and willing to bow to our interests. To better our interests in the region, we should support Ma Luoxi, to prepare the region to be integrated into our colonial rule."
 dvg_zhourao.706.d0: "News from Zhusha has reached us, it seems that their Sultan has collapsed, which presents us an opportunity. There are two princes fighting for control of the throne, who are siding with the powers of Japan and the Dual Monarchy. This cannot be allowed to continue. We have been contacted by resistance elements looking for our support in overthrowing the monarchy, and, should we have finished the unification of the Southern Kongsi, we can look towards funding them."
 dvg_zhourao.706.f: "With the father dead, the sons fight for their position."
 dvg_zhourao.706.a: "We will ensure Ma Lushou wins"
 dvg_zhourao.706.b: "We will ensure Ma Luoxi wins"
 dvg_zhourao.706.c: "We will take advantage of this chaos"
 dvg_zhourao.707.t: "The Prince Returns!"
 dvg_zhourao.707.d: "The Yalai's raids have been met, and the frontier has become a bit safer, as Yalai forces were routed in several battles, our army once more proves itself."
 dvg_zhourao.707.f: "We have proven the Yalai to be well within our reach."
 dvg_zhourao.707.a: "From Lushou, the will of God flows to smite the heathen."
 dvg_zhourao.707.b: "From Luoxi, the will of God flows to smite the heathen."
 dvg_zhourao.708.t: "To March Southwards"
 dvg_zhourao.708.d: "The Yalai's raids have been met, and the frontier has become a bit safer, as Yalai forces were routed in several battles, our army once more proves itself."
 dvg_zhourao.708.f: "Lets get down to business."
 dvg_zhourao.708.a: "It is through the sword that Zhourao will be united."

 dvg_zhourao.714.t: "Siege of Capital"
 dvg_zhourao.715.t: "The Rise of the Xinjiao"
 dvg_zhourao.715.d: "A new Sufi order in Zhusha known as the Xinjiao has begun to open lodges across the nation. The Xinjao are modernists who want a purified, literalist Islam, in opposition to other forms of Sufism which they allege have been too conciliatory to other faiths to the point of diluting their religion and even committing shirk. They emphasize the supreme authority of the Holy Quran and embrace only a small number of hadiths. The Xinjao are sponsored by Malay traders who have made the Hajj, and are influenced by developments in Islamic jurisprudence within Arabia. In addition to this theological rigidity, they stress the importance of temperance, zakat, and education, making them quite popular, especially with prince Lushou, who has taken their cause under his wing."
 dvg_zhourao.715.f: "Shirk is the Islamic sin of idolatry or polytheism. Hadiths are the reported words and actions of the Prophet Muhammed, often supplementing the Quran itself. The Hajj is the pilgramage to Mecca. Zakat is the Islamic concept of holy charity."
 dvg_zhourao.715.a: "Intriguing"
 dvg_zhourao.716.t: "Developments of the Jinxingtang"
 dvg_zhourao.716.d: "The Jingxingtang, meaning Gold Star Hall after the magnificent hall commissioned by the first Sultan, Ma Zicheng\Muhammad to be built next to the Gongbei of the Sufi Master Hu Qixi, is the most prominent sufi order of the Sultanate. Since the formation of the Sultanate, this school of thought has worked to reconcile Islam and Confucianism, notably with the Han Kitab, a collection of Islamic texts combining Han, for Chinese, with Kitab, the Arab word for book. Their academy has thus developed into both a madrasah and a Chinese academy, with courses on the Quran alongside the Chinese classics. The Jinxingtang thus acts both as a Sufi order, one of the highest education centers of the country and also a provider of most of the highest officials of the state that pass the state examinations."
 dvg_zhourao.716.f: "While the Xinjiao are supported by Lushou, Luoxi is a supporter of the Jinxingtang school."
 dvg_zhourao.716.a: "The teachings of the Sages of East and West, today as in ancient times, are one."
 dvg_zhourao.1000.t: "Zhusha Marches South!"
 dvg_zhourao.1000.d: "Whilst Zhusha had been rent with instability, it seems in recent years they have recovered, and now aim to march south in one final push, to fully destroy us now that we have divided."
 dvg_zhourao.1000.f: "Heaven is to be rent asunder."
 dvg_zhourao.1000.a: "The war is rapidly becoming completely untenable."
 dvg_zhourao.1000.b: "An ally in the short term, but their entrance will complicate things greatly..."

 dvg_carlshavn.40.d: "An insulting offer from Scandinavia has just reached us, they are demanding we submit to their rule in exchange for their protection. Whilst this would save us from being defeated by Mianjin, it would subordinate our nation forever to Scandinavia."

 #Decisions
 dvg_southern_attack_again: "Attack Southwards"
 dvg_southern_attack_again_desc: "The time has come to reignite the flames of war between ourselves and the southern Kongsi. They were once part of our nation, it is time they join the sultanate again."
 dvg_stay_catholic: "The Religious Debate"
 dvg_stay_catholic_desc: "With the unification of Zhourao, the topic of the domination of our country by Catholic Oligarchs has come into frame. The lower classes resent this, and any attempt at converting them might very well lead to another Kongsi war..."
 dvg_noongar_colony: "Expand our Colony in Cap Weltevree"
 dvg_noongar_colony_desc: "The Noongar people of Cap Weltevree, as we have taken to calling our soon to be province, are loosely organized. However, their contact with the Chinese settlers in Zhourao has greatly advanced their people, and it seems that in the near future we might be looking at some form of unification of the Noongar people. We should aim to eliminate them as a threat before it can reach that level, and establish the land as a new province in our colonial empire."
 dvg_pitjantjajara_colony: "Claim the Tanami Desert"
 dvg_pitjantjajara_colony_desc: "Quite frankly, the Tanami desert is worthless. Our preliminary searches have revealed nothing but a harsh and savage people whose heathenry is unrivaled in the continent. However, the land is strategically located in the center of the continent, and the small native population cannot resist our efforts to seize it."
 Though it might take time, we should look towards enforcing our claim to the inner deserts of Zhourao"
 dvg_yolngu_colony: "Expand our Colony in Margere"
 dvg_yolngu_colony_desc: "The Northern Region of Zhourao is not the best location for a settler colony. It is a Jungle where it is not a desert, and the territory suitable for settlers is limited to a band around the coast in certain areas. However, our rivals are looking to control the region, and there are many souls there we could convert. Furthermore, though the region is not the most livable, it is located strategically, through it and our islands, we can control a great deal of trade from the Chinese polities in the east, as well as look to dominate Zhusha."
 dvg_nunga_colony: "Claim Terejean"
 dvg_nunga_colony_desc: "We should expand our colony east, to border the Zhourao."
 dvg_yamatji_colony: "Expand our colony in Nouvelle Zélande"
 dvg_yamatji_colony_desc: "While currently used as a penal colony for our East Indies Company, the area around our holdings in western Zhourao would do far better off under our control."
 dvg_kauri_colony: "Claim the Yongjia Gulf"
 dvg_kauri_colony_desc: "We should claim the valuable Yongjia gulf, without a united Zhourao state, this will undoubtedly be easy. If however, the Zhourao were to unite, they could seize the region themselves."
 dvg_push_southwards: "Push Southwards!"
 dvg_push_southwards_desc: "To ensure our nation's national interest, it is necessary to push the borders southwards into the Hongshan tribes currently inhabiting the area"
 dvg_new_zealand: "Create the Dominion of Nouvelle Zélande"
 dvg_new_zealand_desc: "In recent years, colonists in Nouvelle Zélande have begun increasingly demanding home rule. It would be of interest to our country to avoid a situation akin to our former Amerigan and Arcadian colonies, and instead let them have limited self-rule, all for the purpose of serving Burgundy."
 dvg_new_zealand_integrations: "Integrate Territories into Nouvelle Zélande"
 dvg_new_zealand_integrations_desc: "We can integrate our new lands in Zhourao into Nouvelle Zélande, should we choose to."
 dvg_wiradjuri_war: "Push the Border West"
 dvg_wiradjuri_war_desc: "We should aim to create a buffer zone between Mianjin and the European Colonies. We have come to a border agreement with the Europeans on a potential border, now all that is left is to seize the land from the Hongshanman who inhabit it!"
 dvg_propose_to_yaluo: "Propose increased trade with Yaluo"
 dvg_propose_to_yaluo_desc: "We should aim to further our interests in the region of Zhourao, and a good start would be to open Yaluo's ports to our traders"
 dvg_yaluo_ask_scandinavia_for_help: "Ask Scandinavia for aid against Mianjin"
 dvg_yaluo_ask_scandinavia_for_help_desc: "With our closer relationship to Scandinavia, we can ask for assistance in the coming war with Mianjin. This will not be free, however, and many in the Zongting worry about the concessions that Scandinavia might require of us. We can always refuse their offer, however, but it will no doubt damage our relationship with Scandinavia."
 dvg_integrate_the_guli: "Integrate the Guli Confederation"
 dvg_integrate_the_guli_desc: "If we are to unite Zhourao, we must first unite ourselves. Whilst relations with the Hongshan have been at times strained, they have  We should petition the Guli to join our nation."
 dvg_declare_war_on_yaluo: "Declare War on Yaluo!"
 dvg_declare_war_on_yaluo_desc: "The time has come for a Second Kongsi war. We must strike first, for that will ensure our victory."
 dvg_declare_war_on_mianjin: "Declare War on Mianjin!"
 dvg_declare_war_on_mianjin_desc: "The time has come for a Second Kongsi war. We must strike first, for that will ensure our victory."
 dvg_embrace_the_koori: "Embrace the Guli"
 dvg_embrace_the_koori_desc: "The Zongting forcing the northeastern Hui to give the Hongshan tribes their promised tribute has angered a conservative minority within Yaluo, but earned us the friendship and loyalty of the Hongshan tribes. Relations between our peoples are better than they have ever been, and Yaluo can truly claim to be a beacon of unity and equality across Zhourao. Now, a new reform will strengthen our bonds of fellowship even further. A law has been proposed by the Zongting granting each Hongshan tribe full and equal membership in the League alongside the Hui, allowing each to send their own delegate. The expanded League will guarantee the rights and equality of all its people. While the tyrants in Mianjin sneer at our acceptance of the so-called "barbarians," we know that we have much to learn from the ancient culture and stewardship of the Hongshan"
 dvg_songyan_society: "Sponsor the Songyan in Zhusha"
 dvg_songyan_society_desc: "Should we unify southern Zhourao, we can look towards taking advantage of the instability in our northern neighbor, Zhusha. After the death of the Red Sultan, they have begun a civil conflict between the two princes. We have already been contacted by groups looking to overthrow the Sultanate and join with us, their brothers in the south."
 dvg_zhr_press_west: "Press Westwards"
 dvg_zhr_press_west_desc: "Now that Zhourao proper has been unified, we should look to establish dominance over the European Colonies to our west. This will be a difficult prospect, given their large armies and navies, however, so we should look for a good opportunity to take advantage of."
