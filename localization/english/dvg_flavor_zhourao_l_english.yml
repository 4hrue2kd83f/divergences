 dvg_carlshavn.40.t: "Scandinavia Offers us 'Protection'"
 dvg_carlshavn.40.d: "An insulting offer from Scandinavia has just reached us, they are demanding we submit to their rule in exchange for their protection. Whilst this would save us from being defeated by Mianjin, it would subordinate our nation forever to Scandinavia."

 dvg_carlshavn.51.t: "Yaluo Refuses Our Aid!
 dvg_carlshavn.51.d: "Yaluo has declined our aid, our advisors warn that asking for complete rights to Yongjia might have been to far for the Yaluo. It is a grave insult that we shall not easily forget."

 dvg_carlshavn.53.a: "No deal, we are not in the business of negotiating with our inferiors."
 dvg_carlshavn.53.b: "It is still acceptable, even if it is not ideal."
 dvg_carlshavn.54.t: "Scandinavia Refuses Our Offer!"
 dvg_carlshavn.54.d: "We seem to have been reaching too much in offering the Scandinavians a counter offer, their delegation has left enraged by our refusal to grant them rights to the Yongjia. Some worry that this might lead to the Scandinavians descending upon our country in the future..."

 dvg_carlshavn.54.a: "Unfortunate"
