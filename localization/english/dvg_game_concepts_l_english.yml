After the crushing of the German Revolution, the European Enlightenment is considered to have faded, though its ideas live on in the New World through the liberal republics of Belgium and Atlantia."

Some native groups are even reported to have adopted the term as a self-descriptor, considering it as a mark of pride against colonialism, cultural assimilation, and the disruption of traditional ecosystems."

Yet the harsh environment of the Pampas and harrassment by [concept_dvg_anglois] corsairs quickly put an end to this illusion.\n\nYet rather than leasing their platine land to a company charter, the Burgundian Crown sought to kill two birds with one stone by encouraging the Anglican refugee population of the Netherlands, who frequently caused tensions with the locals and the neighboring Dual Monarchy, to settle the 'vast and fertile lands' of Southern Ameriga. After the Lotharian War of Independence, those of Anglo descent who remained in the new Francophone Republic became known as the Anglo-Lotharians, while those of radical sects and cultural purists travelled further south, founding the Kingdom of Beornia."

 concept_dvg_mapuche: "Mapuche"
 concept_dvg_mapuche_desc: "The Mapuche are a Native Amerigan ethnic group who inhabit the southern Andes and the region of Patagonia.

Though the Spanish Armada had a decisive advantage in the early stages of the war, their assaults on the Burgundian Treasure Fleet, which was stationed on the port of Arica to trade with the Incans, resulted in the Burgundian Crown intervening and forcing the Spanish to sue for peace."
