  dvg_plantagenia.1.d: "As 1836 Approaches, [Plantagenia] "
  dvg_plantagenia.1.f: "Plantagenia is a kingdom facing uncertain times. Ever since the unexpected death of King Édouard I de Orleans several years ago his young son Louis I has had a regency council operating the government in his stead. This has kept the bare minimum of the government running but the lack of central leadership and the overall sense of an unknown future has left many Plantagenians feeling wary of their own government. The Peculiar Institution (the chattel slavery of Afro-Frankish peoples in Plantagenia) the opposition of Queen-Regent Catherine de Valois-Medici to it and the relations with native peoples are all putting pressure on Plantagenian society and its entrenched Planteur power structure. Furthermore relations with the Belgian Confederacy the Colombian Alliance and the Scandinavian colonies are fraught with tensions over various border disputes. If Plantagenia is to escape the chains of the past and head into the future someone will have to loosen her bonds…or break them entirely..."

  dvg_plantagenia.2.d: "The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('landowners_scope').GetName] have suffered many grievances under the reign of [SCOPE.sCharacter('louis_scope').GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [SCOPE.sCharacter('louis_scope').GetFirstName]. Many now openly oppose the [GetLawType('law_monarchy').GetName] in favor of an [SCOPE.sIdeology('elitist_scope').GetName] [GetLawType('law_presidential_republic').GetName]."
  dvg_plantagenia.2.f: "Moments earlier, Senhor [SCOPE.sCharacter('landowner_leader').GetLastNameNoFormatting] waved away the carts that took away the last of his slaves. As the sun set and the cart trundled out of sight, he slammed the door shut. Seven generations on the plantation now ruined on his watch. It seemed that the King's senses had finally failed.\n\nNow, with rum in one hand and a pen in the other, he wrote to his neighbors. Perhaps the other plantation owners likewise felt a change was in order."
  dvg_plantagenia.2.f2: "Moments before, writs and invoices were scattered over Senhor [SCOPE.sCharacter('landowner_leader').GetLastNameNoFormatting]'s sprawling desk. The imperial taxes were one thing, imports and exports another, and security for the coffee plantation were a third. All of them combined were breaking the estate. The King would have no hand to help, only to take. [SCOPE.sCharacter('landowner_leader').GetFirstNameNoFormatting] was sure he wasn't the only one buckling under laws.\n\nNow, with rum in one hand and a pen in the other, he wrote to his neighbors. Perhaps the other plantation owners likewise felt a change was in order."
  dvg_plantagenia.2.a: "A worrying turn of events."
  dvg_plantagenia.3.t: "An Early Coronation"
  dvg_plantagenia.3.d: "Hoping to gain political capital, the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('coronation_ig').GetName] regency has decided to crown [SCOPE.sCharacter('louis_scope').GetFullName] as [SCOPE.sCharacter('louis_scope').GetPrimaryRoleTitle] of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] significantly earlier than planned."

  dvg_plantagenia.4.t: "The King's Ill Health"
  dvg_plantagenia.4.d: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('louis_scope').GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [SCOPE.sCharacter('louis_scope').GetFullName] is no longer the young, healthy man he once was. His ability to perform his functions as monarch are in decline. Speculation and scheming surrounds the matter of succession and the future of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] government."
  dvg_plantagenia.4.f: "Entropy comes for all things, great and small. Whether by sword or decay, the King of Plantagenia was destined to meet an end. Decades of delayed stress, forced action, and dynamic industry have finally damned him. Sickness would have its dues soon, and the vultures in his court would gladly feast on such a grand carcass."
  dvg_plantagenia.4.a: "No man lives forever."

  dvg_plantagenia.5.d: "The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('marginal_ig_scope').GetName], once a great potential threat to the [GetLawType('law_monarchy').GetName] of [SCOPE.sCharacter('louis_scope').GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [SCOPE.sCharacter('louis_scope').GetFirstName], have become politically marginalized. This is surely a positive omen for the future stability of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] government."
  dvg_plantagenia.5.f: "Generals and admirals stood at attention behind their civilian ministers. The ministers themselves were less dignified than their counterparts. The directive came: ministries closed, offices diminished, and connections severed. Whatever power they wielded now was but a whisper amidst a storm.\n\nOf course, the military would rise again. A strong arm is needed in a dangerous world. For now, they were at Dom Pedro's side rather than his throat."
  dvg_plantagenia.5.f2: ""What is the meaning of this? I bought you all, housed you all, even freed you at great cost to my family. And this is how you repay me? By taking everything I haven't nailed down!"\n\n"Smile, Senhor. Order and progress have made it so we are both hard working men. Your coffee is of great value to everyone in Plantagenia. The Imperador offers his thanks, as well as remuneration."\n\n"Peanuts! I'm offered peanuts! I'll not be mocked this way. Mark my words, there will be recompense!""

  dvg_plantagenia.6.d: "The growing resentment of the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('powerful_ig_scope').GetName] is becoming difficult to ignore. These powerful elites wield great sway in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], and their lack of inclusion in government further turns them against [SCOPE.sCharacter('louis_scope').GetFirstName]'s [GetLawType('law_monarchy').GetName]."
  dvg_plantagenia.6.f: "Generals wear finery, and ship officers flaunt lavish gifts beyond their stations. Enlisted troops speak so highly of the civilian ministers that one might question their true loyalties. Meanwhile, those same ministers begin overstepping their bounds. With the armed forces trained enough to look away, who would stop them from taking what they demand?"
  dvg_plantagenia.6.f2: ""My son, come. You are coming of age now, and one day I will be too old to work this estate. Look over this balcony and take in what you see. It is yours. The peons in the fields are yours. The coffee in this field and the cows in the next are also yours. The town, its people, and the very forests are yours. And I'm told your days at university are well spent. That ministerial seat you eye, if you work hard for it, will also be yours. And so it will also be for your son.""
  dvg_plantagenia.6.a: "This warrants careful attention."

  dvg_plantagenia.7.d: "With the solemn passing of King Pedro II, a week of mourning has bee declared across [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameNoFormatting]. His reign will surely be remembered as one of the greatest periods of our nation's history. Plans must now begin for the coronation of [SCOPE.sCharacter('new_brz_monarch_scope').GetFullName], who the people look to with admiration and respect to lead them onwards."
  dvg_plantagenia.7.f: "Old tales once held that Heaven weeps when a great man dies. When Dom Pedro of Bragança died, there was scarcely a moment without rain. Tens of thousands lined his funeral procession, wearing black and flying Plantageniaian flags. Dignitaries from as far as Japan bore witness to the event, each laying forth their own tokens of respect.\n\nThe heavy crown that once harrowed [SCOPE.sCharacter('new_brz_monarch_scope').GetHerHis]'s father now loomed over [SCOPE.sCharacter('new_brz_monarch_scope').GetHerHis].

Though many wished to fight to defend the government and the [SCOPE.sCharacter('louis_scope').GetPrimaryRoleTitle], the former monarch has urged peace and abdicated the throne."
  dvg_plantagenia.8.f: ""So that is that, is it?"\n\n"Yes, your majesty. You and your family are no longer in power. There's to be a republic. The new powers that be want you… removed to Europe, while they consolidate new power."\n\n"Very well. If it is so, it will be my retirement. I have worked too hard and I am tired. I will go rest then.""
