 dvg_poland.1.t:0 "The Rzeczpospolita"
 dvg_poland.1.d:0 "Oh, how the mighty have fallen, we, whose domains once spanned all of the lands east of oder."
 dvg_poland.1.f:0 "The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth has been in decline since the XVIIth century. The crown of Poland and Lithuania was forced to give several concessions to the nobility over the centuries making the elected King nothing more than a glorified puppet in the hands of the Magnates holding huge domains where serfdom still prevails. The Union between the crown of Poland and its Ruthenian and Lithuanian territories has weakened as the Hetmans and foreign powers influence the governors of these areas. Poland is not vulnerable to Revolution thanks to a relatively Liberal political situation but if the Magnates aren't kept in check it's hard to see what will happen to Poland"

 dvg_poland.4.d:0 "Since time immemorial, our peoples have been oppressed and humiliated, by the Norse, Tatars, Lithuanians, and now by the Poles. But the time has come to end it for good!

 dvg_poland.6.d:0 "Rejoice, people rejoice, for it is a day that your children will celebrate for centuries. By the decree of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] our eastern brethren have been recognized as our equals. Many have voiced their concerns and called Ruthenians, lazy, arrogant and unfit called to be citizens of Commonwealth, but those voices now have no power, for King's word is final and we us his loyal subjects must accept Ruthenians as our brothers and sisters."

 dvg_poland.11.f:0 "Despite the news of the loss of the allegiance of the Cossack hosts and of the principality of Smolensk the Sejm continued to be deadlocked. Eventually the Sejm would have to choose the candidates for the election. After weeks of debates 4 candidates demarked themselves : Franz von Schwarzenberg, a cadet of one of the greatest Bohemian nobility. Johannes von Wettin cousin of the duke of Prussia supported by Scandinavians. Sigismund von Wittelsbach, a neutral German prince that is amenable to much of the factions. And finally the Sejm must decide if Stanislaw Habsburg is put into the list or not."
 dvg_poland.11.a:0 "Stanislaw is on the list, he cannot be elected anyway."

 dvg_poland.14.t:0 "The Sejm of 1840"
 dvg_poland.14.d:0 "Stanislaw I Faces Resistance in Assembling Confederated Sejm, Reforms Stifled by Nobility's Opposition"
 dvg_poland.14.f:0 "Following his election, Stanislaw I tried several times to assemble a confederated Sejm, a type of assembly where the liberum veto could not be used as to pass several laws and appease the liberals of the various towns. Despite all his efforts, the opposition of the nobility led to no consensus and he was forced to call a regular Sejm that was blocked by several noblemen who used their golden liberties to stop all attempts at reform."

 dvg_poland.15.d:0 "Violent Clashes in Warsaw as Reform Supporters Target Anti-Reform Noblemen; King Intervenes to Restore Order"
 dvg_poland.15.f:0 "Following the results of the Sejm, the liberals and people of Warsaw assaulted several noblemen notoriously known for their opposition to reforms in the capital. Order was only restored after the intervention of the Royal guards, with the King himself protecting his opponent Jozef Potocki who found shelter in the Royal Palace after nearly being killed by the crowd. This event has reinforced the will of the reformers who are now persuaded that only them stand between chaos and the preservation of order while magnates are scared and hire more members for their guards."

 dvg_poland.16.d:0 "King Stanislaw's Ambitions"
 dvg_poland.16.f:0 "King Stanislaw’s reign has not been fruitful. The magnates, not just in Poland proper but in the outlying regions which supposedly pay him homage, continue to conspire against the throne. If the King is to bring about his vision of a united Commonwealth, ready to face the future, then he can no longer be bound by the odious “Golden Liberties.” He is mindful that many junior officers within the Polish military as well as the urban bourgeoisie loathe the szlachta and their entrenched privileges. Some of the more paranoid nobles have spread rumors that the Sejm of 1845 is a trap, and that Stanislaw will, upon its opening, launch a military coup d’etat in the name of crushing plots against the Crown, and lay the groundwork for a permanent, parliamentary Sejm based on a modern constitution instead of medieval documents. If so, then the lands beyond the Polish heartland will surely look to outside powers to protect them from the King’s ambitions. Are the rumors true?"

 dvg_poland.19.d:0 "Stanislaw's Assumption of Dictatorial Authority Sparks Prussian Crisis: Scandinavia's Annexation Looms Over the Baltic"
 dvg_poland.19.f:0 "The first casualty of Stanislaw’s assumption of dictatorial authority was Prussia. Ever since the first Prussian Homage of 1525 which transformed the old Order State of the Teutonic Knights into the Duchy of Prussia as a Polish vassal, some have seen this arrangement as the equivalent of clutching a viper to our breast. Those fears have been borne out, as the Prussian Balters, steeped in feudalism, are terrified at Stanislaw’s assault upon noble privilege. Thus they have sought Scandinavia’s protection against us, and Copenhagen has obliged, proclaiming Prussia’s annexation! Scandinavian troops have been welcomed with open arms by the Balters, and Scandinavia, keen to dominate the Baltic, will surely not stop at annexing Ducal Prussia…"

Ever since the first Prussian Homage of 1525 which transformed the old Order State of the Teutonic Knights into the Duchy of Prussia as a Polish vassal, there have been those who saw the arrangement as the equivalent of clutching a viper to our breast. Those fears have been borne out, as the Prussian Balters, steeped in feudalism, are terrified at Stanislaw’s assault upon noble privilege. Thus, in an ostentatious ceremony in Konigsberg, Duke of Prussia Ruprecht II von Wettin has declared Prussia’s independence! All forces of the Commonwealth are being driven from the rebellious duchy, and while it is unlikely to survive on its own, it may have greater ambitions…"

 dvg_poland.21.d:0 "Rising Tensions in the Commonwealth: The Czestochowa Confederation's Defiance Against King Stanislaw"
 dvg_poland.21.f:0 "The szlachta of the Commonwealth are nothing if not persistent. After Stanislaw abruptly ended the Sejm of 1845 by arresting many of the nobles in attendance and declaring his intention to abolish the old laws in favor of primogeniture succession and a permanent, parliamentary Sejm, magnates from throughout the realm gathered at the fortress in Czestochowa, on the German border. There they have proclaimed Stanislaw’s actions to be illegal, and have formed a konfederacja (confederation), the type of military association which has periodically arisen throughout Polish history. This Czestochowa Confederation seeks the overthrow of King Stanislaw by any means necessary. The great nations of Europe have declared their support for the Confederation, condemning Stanislaw as a crazed radical. In the midst of this treason, the Uman Confederation has also broken ties with the Commonwealth, though they have not pledged support to the magnates."

 dvg_poland.22.f:0 "The Polish magnates have reacted to Stanislaw establishing a royal dictatorship at the Sejm of 1846 by forming the Czestochowa Confederation and seeking Bohemia’s help in ousting Stanislaw. With war brewing, the Ruthenian nobles have convened their own rada and decided to declare neutrality in the conflict. We shall not aid any of Poland’s enemies, but neither shall we shed our blood for their cause."

 je_golden_liberty_reason: "The Szlachta has dominated our politics for centuries and they still make a very important part of our politics, but what was once called The Golden Liberty which made Commonwealth a beacon of tolerance and freedom now drags us down like an iron chain, preventing our state from modernizing, to cure our ills we must either curtail Szlachta's privileges or appease them by cementing their position."
 je_eastern_resistance_reason: "The vast swaths of land that make up our eastern holdings have been largely neglected for the most part of our history and what once made up The Great Kyivan Rus now is place of constant Tatar raids and exploitative serfdom of The Szlachta, if we don't end their plight and allow them to flourish within our borders, they eventually will rise up and take the matter into their own hands, which will mean the end of The Commonwealth."

 sejm_of_1845_reason: "Stanislaw's decision to assert royal authority and dissolve the Sejm in 1845 stemmed from a deep-seated frustration with the political discord and inefficiency within the Sejm. He believed that a more decisive form of governance was necessary to bring stability and progress to Poland, leading him to initiate the transition towards a more centralized form of rule."

On his death, the Sejm will convene and the primary candidate, his son Stanislaw is in a good position to succeed him."
