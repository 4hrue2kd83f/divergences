 ### Descriptions
  objectives_new_this_patch_desc: "Thank you for playing Victoria 3 Divergences!\nIn this screen you can see some of the countries which have received brand new content in the latest version of the mod. Have fun!"
  objectives_old_order_desc: "Revered emperors and privileged lordships, these countries are the epitome of 'l'Ancien Régime'. Though the throes of progress threaten them with decline, they must not fall! Embark on a crusade against this so-called 'modernity' and prove it to be no more than a passing fad, powerless before the might of tradition."
  objectives_mercantilists_desc: "With large navies and vast ambitions, these countries derive their wealth from their myriad trade routes and scattered outposts across the globe. And so long as that wealth flows, be that gold, fabric, or slaves, these states (and their rich) are sure to prosper. Go forth and rule the waves!"
  objectives_paternals_desc: "'Strong armies and secure borders' is these countries' maxim, for modernity must not be embraced, but carefully picked through by a gloved hand. It is only through this oversight, gentle yet firm like the care of a father, that our country may grow strong and avoid sickness. After all, what is a nation without a strong ruler?"
  objectives_revolutionaries_desc: "'Freedom, Equality and Brotherhood!' cry the oppressed masses across all corners of the world, for too long have they been subject to the whims of oppressors and tyrants. What these countries lack for in power, they more than make up for with the indomitable dedication of a populace certain that the Old Order is soon to be washed away. Provided, of course, that they do not collapse into infighting."

 ### The Old Order
  objectives_old_order_name_DUA: "Royaume-Uni"
  objectives_old_order_desc_DUA: "#lore The United Kingdom of France and England, or the 'Dual Monarchy', is one of the most prestigious states in Europe. Forged in the flames of the Hundred Years' War, the blessed Plantagenat dynasty has carefully steered the ship of state for over four centuries, expertly managing the interests of its myriad subjects.\n\nThough some claim the union to be 'obsolete', a 'feudal relic', we know this to be no more than vulgar perfidy! Our divine state has resisted the test of time, aging its foundations into a robust marble, and no passing fad such as this so-called nationalism will see it torn down."

  objectives_old_order_name_BOH: "Heiliges Römisches Reich"
  objectives_old_order_desc_BOH: "#lore The Holy Roman Empire needs no introduction. It is, after all, the premier nation of Europe, and its ruler the only one who can truly claim emperorship. Under the will of the Kaiser and the Electorate, the empire has survived into the Modern Age, even when the Radicalist barbarians sought to destroy it in their so-called '[concept_dvg_german_revolution]'.\n\nNow the fool [concept_dvg_dahlke] is dead, much like the bastard usurper [concept_dvg_ludwig], and our newly-crowned Kaiser Sigismund assumes his divine mantle as heir to [concept_dvg_wenceslaus]. Long live the King of the Romans! And long live the European Throne!"

  objectives_old_order_name_MUG: "Hindustān"
  objectives_old_order_desc_MUG: "#lore The Mughal Empire"

  objectives_old_order_name_FRS: "Dà Ming"
  objectives_old_order_desc_FRS: "#lore For three centuries the Ming were the undisputed sovereigns of China. Yet it was invasion by the barbarous Manchus and the betrayal of the peasant 'Shun dynasty' which led to their fall from grace. Now exiled to the island of Taiwan, the King of Tungning has claimed the title of 'Phoenix Emperor', swearing to return to the mainland.\n\nUnlike the other so-called dynasties, we will not bend before foreigners, be they European or Japanese! Rather, our Self-Strengthening Movement and Confucian tradition is all we need to bring back noble and righteous governance."

  ### The Mercantilists
  objectives_mercantilists_name_JAP: "Dai Nippon Teikoku"
  objectives_mercantilists_desc_JAP: "#lore All European merchants heading to the East know to relish at the sight of ships bearing the flag of the IJN. After all, the Red Seal System and its anti-piracy measures ensure the personal oversight of the Emperor should any disputes arise the in the Pacific Ocean, an area now known to many as the 'Japanese Lake'.\n\nEven then, there are those who chafe at this surveillance, finding it hard to compete with the privileged status of goods produced in the Home Islands. They are bandits, of course, and so long as no new canals are opened, the Pacific shall remain our imperial monopoly."

  objectives_mercantilists_desc_VEN: "#lore The Most Serene Republic of Venice"

  ### The Paternalists
  objectives_paternals_name_BRG: "Royaume de Bourgogne"
  objectives_paternals_desc_BRG: "#lore Though the Kingdom of Burgundy is indisputably the most powerful nation in the world, it suffers from a festering illness of passivity and corruption. In the wake of a series of weak monarchs, who preferred to delegate tasks to Parliament instead of assuming their royal duties, Oligarchs from the [concept_dod_voc] have carved out the nation between themselves and now scheme to sell out its sovereignty to the highest bidder.\n\nNo more! Already whispers abound in the streets of a mighty hero, a Philosopher-King of the Modern Era, come to deliver upon the realm to its rightful claim of Master of Europe. The New Order awaits!"

  objectives_paternals_name_PLA: "Royaume Plantagenet"
  objectives_paternals_desc_PLA: "#lore The Kingdom of Plantagenia is akin to a house divided, nearly collapsing under its own weight and weak foundations. Defined by its 'peculiar institution' of slavery, political power is entirely concentrated in the hands of the [concept_dvg_planteur]. Though the young King Louis has different ideas.\n\nSince his youth, Louis has been a child of the [concept_dvg_enlightenment] and a lover of the open range, preferring to spend his time riding alongside Cowboys and Indians instead of rubbing elbows with Lords in Nouvelle-Orléans. Now, as tensions rise along the Belgian border, it's made clear that the Cowboy King's golden hour is fast approaching."

  objectives_paternals_name_TWT: "Tawantinsuyu"
  objectives_paternals_desc_TWT: "#lore Some say the social structure of the Incan Empire is much like the mountains it resides upon: a sharp pyramid. And who could reign from atop that pyramid but the Son of the Sun himself?\n\nUnlike the petty lords of Europe, the [concept_dvg_sapa_inka] is a benevolent and enlightened ruler, who cares for his subjects much as he would his own children. Though the Spanish barbarians lurk in the north, all loyal subjects know it is only a matter of time before the empire reclaims its glory and gets its groove back on."

  objectives_paternals_name_LOT: "État Lotharingien"
  objectives_paternals_desc_LOT: "#lore After its winning its independence from Burgundy, the Lotharingian Republic failed to find its footing, instead becoming stage to a brutal civil war between myriad factions seeking control for themselves. From this struggle arose Chef Denis de Aigle, Father of the Nation.\n\nUnder his firm yet loving rule, we have prospered, and stability finally returned to these war-torn lands. Yet we must not dawdle, for the enemies of the state are many, and could lurk across any corner, be them imperialist spies or savage Incan raiders. Hail to the Chef!"

  ### The Revolutionaries
  objectives_revolutionaries_name_GCO: "Aliança Colombiana"
  objectives_revolutionaries_desc_GCO: "#lore The Colombian Alliance"

  objectives_revolutionaries_name_ATL: "République Atlantien"
  objectives_revolutionaries_desc_ATL: "#lore Ever since the discovery of vast gold reserves in Atlantian territory, once considered little more than a backwater, the region has become known as the 'Crown of [concept_dvg_ameriga]'. After several inconclusive colonial wars, Atlantia was placed under international mandate, with each European power electing delegates to the Golden Board.\n\nSince the 18th century, the gold rushes have directed millions of migrants to the ports of Atlantia, turning the region into a cultural melting pot. And those who manage to hit the jackpot become part of the powerful Nouveau-Riche, agitating for independence and dreaming of a continental republic founded on [concept_dvg_enlightenment] values."

  objectives_revolutionaries_name_TUS: "Repubblica Etrusca"
  objectives_revolutionaries_desc_TUS: "#lore The Etrurian Republic"

  objectives_revolutionaries_name_YLO: "Yaluo Liánsài"
  objectives_revolutionaries_desc_YLO: "#lore Formed via a miner's strike in the [concept_dod_kongsi] of Southern [concept_dod_zhourao], the League of Yaluo is a young republic still struggling to find its footing. Despite this, they are also the only ones in the continent to form alliance with the [concept_dod_hongshan], and several secret societies in the north have sworn to 'follow the example of Yaluo'.\n\nThough they are threatened from all directions, with both European colonists and other Chinese states longing for the destruction, the proud citizens of Yaluo shall not give in! Through the might of the National Revolutionary Army, they shall keep fighting until the continent is united under one banner. For Free Zhourao!"
