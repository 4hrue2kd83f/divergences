  dvg_austria.1.t: "The Archduchy of Austria"
  dvg_austria.1.d: "Many Austrians believe that their archduchy has been dealt a terrible hand in recent history: Siding with the losing factions during the Great German War three times and surrendering to their political archnemesis Bavaria and Bohemia during the Congress of Paris in 1820, Austria has been dismantled to its crownlands. The House of Habsburg-Ravensberg is now stuck in an identity crisis: Isolated by geography and diplomacy, its influence upon the other Danubian states is limited, though a large percentage of the population, inspired by Dahlke's victory against the Wittelsbachs, take pride in their perceived German heritage."

  dvg_austria.3.t: "Trouble in the House of Habsburg"
  dvg_austria.3.d: "Previous Archduke Charles IV's unwillingness to properly govern the archduchy resulted in several revolts against his rule in Rhenish Ravensberg and Carinthia shortly before the Great German War. When Charles IV died, a succession struggle ensued since he left no surviving direct male heirs, though after a bloodless coup his only male grandson Joseph II who initially wasn't intended to rule Austria in the first place gained the crown with the support of the savvy Chancellor Erwin-Adalbert of Sigmaringen. Thus, the surviving daughter Maria Leopoldina and two other elder granddaughters Maria Louise and Clementina were completely overlooked, especially Maria Louise who was old enough at the time to properly rule the archduchy. Maria Louise was later married to a Bavarian prince, who now stands to inherit the Duchy because of the lack of offspring of Wilhelm IV while Clementina defied the Vienna Court by marrying Georg Khevenhüller, a prominent Carinthian noble and converted to Protestantism."

  dvg_austria.30.t: "News from Klagenfurt"
  dvg_austria.30.d: "The years since the Great German War have seen an embryonic Slovenian nationalism begin to coalesce, and the Landtag has begun to reflect this Slovene ascendancy. Now a printer in Klagenfurt has taken to printing a newspaper in the Slovenian language, the first of its kind and one which may set off a domino chain of Slovenian cultural revivalism."
  dvg_austria.30.f: "The 19th century saw a revival of culture in Slovene, accompanied by a Romantic nationalist quest for cultural and political autonomy. The idea of a United Slovenia, first advanced during 1848, became the common platform of most Slovenian parties and political movements in Austria. During the same period, Yugoslavism, an ideology stressing the unity of all South Slavic peoples began to spread."

  dvg_austria.40.t: "The Petition from Slovenia"
  dvg_austria.40.d: "Over the last few years, Slovenian nationalism has coalesced behind a push to make the Landtag more reflective of the population and curtail the power of the German (including the Germanized Slovene) nobility. It was hoped that we could circumvent the Slovenian issue through German nationalism. However, the prospect of becoming a minority in a pan-German (and possibly even officially Catholic) state has sent alarm bells ringing throughout Slovenia, and this fear has manifested in the Landtag. Now a group of notable Carinthian Slovene politicians have arrived in the capital to present a request for a conference between Austrian and Slovene officials to arrive at what they call an Ausgleich, or “Compromise.” It is feared that the Slovene will demand significant cultural and political protections as a condition for supporting the unification of the Danube, but all things considered this is a rather polite request and refusal could cause Carinthian separatism and Slovenian nationalism to merge.

  dvg_austria.50.t: "The Ausgleich"
  dvg_austria.50.d: "The conference between Austrian and Slovene politicians, the latter headed by Slovene politician Peter Miklosich, has been convened. After multiple rounds of heated negotiations, where we were able to convince the Slovenes that independence was off the table, it appears that they want one of two concessions : either autonomy, or the disavowal by Vienna of pan-German projects. The Slovenes have absolutely refused to accept any sort of internal status within a future pan-German state that would not allow their own Landtag to legislate matters within Slovenia. Many of our own politicians believe that these negotiations are a waste of time, though a handful of isolationists have raised the point that a pan-German state could very well subsume the Austrian identity as well. Therefore, they say, the idea of abandoning Danubian unification is not unthinkable. Bavaria would of course be infuriated if we abandon them now for the sake of Carinthia."
