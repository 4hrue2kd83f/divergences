  dvg_austria.1.t: "The Archduchy of Austria"
  dvg_austria.1.d: "Many Austrians believe that their archduchy has been dealt a terrible hand in recent history: Siding with the losing factions during the Great German War three times and surrendering to their political archnemesis Bavaria and Bohemia during the Congress of Paris in 1820, Austria has been dismantled to its crownlands. The House of Habsburg-Ravensberg is now stuck in an identity crisis: Isolated by geography and diplomacy, its influence upon the other Danubian states is limited, though a large percentage of the population, inspired by Dahlke's victory against the Wittelsbachs, take pride in their perceived German heritage. Nonetheless, a significant minority of Protestant Slovenes and Germans in the Duchy of Carinthia rally around the emerging ideals of self-determination against Catholic Vienna or even Munich in the future. Now, the current Archduke, Joseph II, whose succession was more of an unplanned blunder than an expected outcome, will have to lead Austria out of its current misery, and maybe even to greater heights..."

  dvg_austria_.2.t: "News from Klagenfurt"
  dvg_austria_.2.d: "The years since the Great German War have seen an embryonic Slovenian nationalism begin to coalesce, and the Landtag has begun to reflect this Slovene ascendancy. Now a printer in Klagenfurt has taken to printing a newspaper in the Slovenian language, the first of its kind and one which may set off a domino chain of Slovenian cultural revivalism."
  dvg_austria_.2.f: "The March of Carinthia was formed in 889 by King Carloman of the ancient kingdom of Bavaria, granted to his son Arnulf, and was raised to a duchy in 976. Though the composition of the Empire has shifted massively since then, Carinthia's estrangement from the rest of Germany has not. The lower Carinthian nobility, many of them Protestant Germanized Slovenes, have historically exercised great autonomy. Furthermore, many of Carinthia's larger settlements lie south of the Alps, increasing their separation."

  dvg_austria_.3.t: "Trouble in the House of Habsburg"
  dvg_austria_.3.d: "Previous Archduke Charles IV's unwillingness to properly govern the archduchy resulted in several revolts against his rule in Rhenish Ravensberg and Carinthia shortly before the Great German War. When Charles IV died, a succession struggle ensued since he left no surviving direct male heirs, though after a bloodless "coup" his only male grandson Joseph II who initially wasn't intended to rule Austria in the first place gained the crown with the support of the savvy Chancellor Erwin-Adalbert of Sigmaringen. Thus, the surviving daughter Maria Leopoldina and two other elder granddaughters Maria Louise and Clementina were completely overlooked, especially Maria Louise who was old enough at the time to properly rule the archduchy. Maria Louise was later married to a Bavarian prince, who now stands to inherit the Duchy because of the lack of offspring of Wilhelm IV while Clementina defied the Vienna Court by marrying Georg Khevenhüller, a prominent Carinthian noble and converted to Protestantism."
