  dvg_bavaria.1.t: "The Electorate of Bavaria"
  dvg_bavaria.1.d: "Bavaria in recent years has become the envy of the various states of the Holy Roman Empire : It remains the only true victor of the Great German Wars, evident by the lack of large-scale destruction of the electorate and its  expansion to include the former Princely County of Tyrol in 1814 among other territories, confirmed in the Congress of  Paris of 1820."
  dvg_bavaria.1.f: " Guided by two popular dukes in a row, namely Duke Maximilian 'Max' IV 'the Great' von Wittelsbach, whose exceptionally long reign between 1798 and 1832 was marked by the ascendancy of Bavaria in the Danubian Circle, and his only  surviving son William 'Willy' IV, who is ruling Bavaria since 1832. Bavaria is still defining its ambitions in Germany and  its future is unclear. His young age of only 31 gives him plenty of time to shape the destiny of Bavaria. That is, of course, unless the vast array of political leaders and ideologues which the electorate of Bavaria houses force him into  another direction."
  dvg_bavaria.1.a: "The future lies before us..."

  dvg_bavaria.2.t: "Constitution - Religious Rights"
  dvg_bavaria.2.d: "Bavaria weathered the Protestant Reformation without any new sect taking hold in the realm over the long term. While once regarded as a shining beacon of the Catholic faith in Germany, the recent influx of political refugees, the growth of liberalism, and the rise of Reform Judaism bringing more Jewish Bavarians into the political sphere has called the legal place of the Church within the Electorate into question."
  dvg_bavaria.2.f: "Conservatives are adamant that Catholicism is so fundamental to our identity that it must be preserved. Liberals take the opposite view, arguing that it is precisely this devotion to religious dogma which is holding Bavaria back from progress and prosperity."
  dvg_bavaria.2.a: "Bavaria will be a state for all Germans regardless of their religion."
  dvg_bavaria.2.b: "Catholicism is a pillar of Bavaria."
  dvg_bavaria.2.c: "Our current laws are fine."

  dvg_bavaria.3.t: "Constitution - Voting Rights"
  dvg_bavaria.3.d: "In recent years people have demanded for more involvements in the political landscape. While it is unusual for common folk to have a say in the affairs of the state. An increasing number of wealthy individuals are seeking more influence."
  dvg_bavaria.3.f: "The Arch-Duke himself has made friends within the capitalist strata and is inclined to give them more influence."
  dvg_bavaria.3.a: "Only aristocrats should vote."
  dvg_bavaria.3.b: "Wealth brings power."
  dvg_bavaria.3.c: "Our current laws are fine."

  dvg_bavaria.4.t: "Constitution - Cultural Rights"
  dvg_bavaria.4.d: "The Great German War has brought many refugees to our lands. Germans of all cultures but even non germans. Our streets are filled with new languages and cultural impressions. The more conservative elements of our society are very concerned about this development."
  dvg_bavaria.4.f: "'Bavaria for Bavarians' ~ Slogan on a conservative poster"
  dvg_bavaria.4.a: "Restrict their rights."
  dvg_bavaria.4.b: "Reduce restrictions."
  dvg_bavaria.4.c: "Our current laws are fine."

  dvg_bavaria.5.t: "Der Karlsbad Tag"
  dvg_bavaria.5.d: "A meeting of Bavarian reactionaries and Great German War veterans has been held in the spa city of Karlsbad, Bohemia. This was no vacation, but rather an informal gathering of noted monarchist and conservative figures from across Bavaria, who felt more comfortable in the Imperial crownlands than in their own, politically polarized country. While no minutes were kept of the meeting, a summary of the conclusions of the “Karlsbad Tag,” which they seek to publish, has been obtained by agents of the crown."
  dvg_bavaria.5.f: "The manifesto calls for the suppression of liberalism and German nationalism within Bavaria, equating it to the murderous tyranny of Marinus Dahlkes Imperial Republic."
  dvg_bavaria.5.a: "Prohibit the manifesto from publication."
  dvg_bavaria.5.b: "Allow them to publish their manifesto in full."

  dvg_bavaria.6.t: "The Innsbruck Festival"
  dvg_bavaria.6.d: "Inspired by the 1836 Karlsbader Tag, liberals have held their own meeting in Innsbruck under the guise of an “apolitical” county fair which drew thousands of attendees. Many participants were university students or others of similar age, animated by notions of democracy and German nationalism. The former held far greater importance at the Innsbruck assembly, which eventually decided to focus on advocating for the new Bavarian constitution to guarantee a strong, elected Landtag and universal suffrage."
  dvg_bavaria.6.f: "Freiheit! Freiheit für unser Deutschland!\n(Freedom! Freedom for our Germany!)"
  dvg_bavaria.6.a: "Imprison them"

  dvg_bavaria.7.t: "Das junge Deutschland"
  dvg_bavaria.7.d: "“Das junge Deutschland” or “Young Germany” is a political club that has has spread across the Empire. It advocates for a single, revolutionary democratic republic “as far as the German tongue sounds, from Holland to Prussia.” It is unclear if all supposed chapters are in fact part of the same organization, but they are much feared by reactionaries. Recently their loyalists in Bavaria committed several robberies to secure funds, and were then arrested in Regensburg, where plans to overthrow the Bavarian government were found. "
  dvg_bavaria.7.f: "Freiheit! Freiheit für unsere Brüder!\n(Freedom! Freedom for our Brothers!)"

  dvg_bavaria.8.t: "The Ducal Pamphlet"
  dvg_bavaria.8.d: "The Ducal Pamphlet is a yearly tradition by which the Duke-Elector of Bavaria can speak directly to his subjects regarding issues of note for the realm. While once a rather symbolic affair, the growth of political turmoil in Bavaria has seen it taken on new emphasis as a window into the minds of the royal court and the administration at large. His Serene Highness the Duke-Elector and his advisors are now drafting the Ducal Pamphlet of 1840, and he is trying to choose a tone for his writing."
  dvg_bavaria.8.f: "Jährlich grüßt das Murmeltier!\n(Every year the marmot greets us!)"
  dvg_bavaria.8.a: "Appeal to the liberals"
  dvg_bavaria.8.b: "Appeal to the conservatives"

  dvg_bavaria.9.t: "Street Violence in Munich"
  dvg_bavaria.9.d: "Liberal public meetings, while legal, have increasingly been targeted by reactionaries. In response, reformists began organizing elaborate banquets to cover their gatherings. Now a banquet held at the home of wealthy liberal lawyer Arnold Rapp has sparked something far more dangerous. The banquet attracted an unprecedented number of guests, frightening the chief of the Munich city guard into dispatching policemen to investigate whether it might be a staging ground for a revolt. Residents of Munich awoke in the night to the sounds of street clashes between city guards and liberal students and activists."
  dvg_bavaria.9.f: "Rechte! Rechte für unsere Bürger!\n(Right! Rights for our Citizens!)"
  dvg_bavaria.9.a: "The police restores order"

  dvg_bavaria.10.t: "Conservative Scandal"
  dvg_bavaria.10.d: "A liberal newspaper in Regensburg has published an Article: “Die Rechte der Reichen“ (the Rights of the Rich). It displays the ways in wich the aristocracy prevents their crimes from beeing persued. While many claim this article is an exaggeration of the situation many liberals across the nation have used this incident as reason to protest."
  dvg_bavaria.10.f: ""
  dvg_bavaria.10.a: "We have to do something"

  dvg_bavaria.11.t: "The trial of Rosenheim"
  dvg_bavaria.11.d: "It does not happen often, that a noble is put before a public court. In most cases this is due to the noble in question having powerful enemies. In this case a lesser noble from Rosenheim was charged for murder. The evidence leaves room for interpretation but the only other possible perpetrator would be his servant. Charging him instead of his master would upset many."
  dvg_bavaria.11.f: ""
  dvg_bavaria.11.a: "He is clearly innocent"
  dvg_bavaria.11.b: "Charge him guilty"
