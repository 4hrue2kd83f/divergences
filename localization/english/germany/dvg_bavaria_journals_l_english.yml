  je_bavarian_constitution: "The Bavarian Constitution"
  je_bavarian_constitution_reason: "Munich has become a hub of intellectuals and political refugees from across Germany, but this has in turn emboldened their reactionary enemies, causing political polarization to rise across Bavaria. If we are to survive the rising tide of political turmoil threatening to once again sweep over Europe, then we shall have to renovate our legal system to satisfy the desires of the people. Thus Duke-Elector Wilhelm IV has tasked his jurists and ministers with drafting a new constitution. This will be a slow and careful process as we must consider its implications for the future of our nation.\n\n@information!#blue Gameplay Advice:\nA series of events will allow us to choose the laws of our new constitution. Decisions here might impact future events and options for this country.#!\n\nCurrent progress:\n[SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('dvg_bav_contitution')]"
