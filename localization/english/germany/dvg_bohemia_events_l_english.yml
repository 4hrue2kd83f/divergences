  dvg_bohemia.1.t: "The Inauguration of the Kaiser Wenceslaus Plaza"
  dvg_bohemia.1.d: "[concept_dvg_wenceslaus], Holy Roman Emperor, reigned throughout the [concept_dvg_german_revolution] and the subsequent Great German War. An ambitious emperor with cunning and intellect, he had quashed the liberals that had given the Empire so much grief while simultaneously fending off coalition after coalition keen on preventing a Bohemian hegemony over Central Europe."
  dvg_bohemia.1.f: "But he was too successful for his own good, and “the Lion of the North”, as he was called after his manyfold victories against the Scandinavians, was eventually forced to sue for peace. He would be murdered the following year and succeeded by his son, Sigismund V, who after a pompous ceremony today had opened a plaza in Prague which lauded his reactionary father’s many achievements. The young emperor promised loftily before a crowd of thousands that his reign will be no less stellar than the last to bear the Imperial Crown."
  dvg_bohemia.1.a: "The people celebrate an Empire of a thousand years!"

  dvg_bohemia.2.t: "Sigismund V"
  dvg_bohemia.2.d: "Sigismund V came to power at the tender age of ten following his father's unceremonious assassination. Those of his old enemies who survived the Revolution denied their involvement in the affair, and rumors indeed abound that the perpetrators hailed from the Bohemian aristocracy, but it had always been clear to Sigismund V that his father was murdered by the cold hands of liberals and republicans."
  dvg_bohemia.2.f: "Despite his unfortunate upbringing, Sigismund clearly inherited both his father's desires for statecraft and his drive to unite the Empire under Bohemian leadership. His staunch, reactionary inclinations, fostered by his mother and her priest entourage has led to tensions with his Chancellor and former Regent, Karl von Schwarzenberg. Time will tell if the Minister can endure his diplomatic endeavors or if the absolutists inclination of the young emperor will prove too strong."
  dvg_bohemia.2.a: "An industrious man for an industrial era!"

  dvg_bohemia.3.t: "The Zeil Oath"
  dvg_bohemia.3.d: "News reached Prague today of notable German liberals having held a banquet in Frankfurt, intently reenacting the infamous and especially treasonous Zeil Oath. Whereas Bohemia proper is crying foul at such a blatant insult to Imperial authority, the Elbians and Danubians are ecstatically celebrating the revival of German liberalism at its very cradle. Time will tell if this heralds a return to the dark days of 1790..."
  dvg_bohemia.3.f: "”My German blood and German treasures I bequeath to a German Constitution, for a German Nation with a German Government of and by and for the German People. This I pledge before God and my fellow oathsworn. Never shall we break and ever shall we gather, for our cause is the cause of the firm and true.”"
  dvg_bohemia.3.a: "Liberalism runs onwards, powered by the approval of the true Germans."

  dvg_bohemia.4.t: "The Zeil Oath"
  dvg_bohemia.4.d: "Today the people of Frankfurt have proved German liberalism is arisen from ruin as they reenacted that momentous banquet in the Zeil forty years ago, when the Grand Judge of Dortmund proclaimed that all true German sons shall resist and reassemble as necessary against Bohemian tyranny until the Emperor promulgates a liberal Imperial Constitution."
  dvg_bohemia.4.f: "”My German blood and German treasures I bequeath to a German Constitution, for a German Nation with a German Government of and by and for the German People. This I pledge before God and my fellow oathsworn. Never shall we break and ever shall we gather, for our cause is the cause of the firm and true.”"
  dvg_bohemia.4.a: "Liberal Ideas live on"
