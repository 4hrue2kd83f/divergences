  dvg_hre.1.t: "Imperial incident: The Bayreuth Constitution"
  dvg_hre.1.d: "In the years after the Great German War, the Electorate of Brandenburg-Bayreuth, formerly a staunch reactionary stronghold who allied with Wenceslaus V and received Nürnberg as a reward, transformed itself into a beacon of liberalism and hope for the peoples of Germany."
  dvg_hre.1.f: "Prince-Elector Leopold IV, Duke of Brandenburg-Bayreuth, and his almost obsessive sponsorship of various intellectuals and creative artists are among the reasons behind the proclamation by the chancellor August von Rixdorf of a charter granting basic rights to the subjects of the Bayreuth throne, and introducing a democratically elected parliament with actual legislative powers. With the obvious inspiration taken from the Zeil Oath, concerns are raised over a potential interference by Sigismund V of Bohemia who warned of such actions in the wake of his ascension to the crown of Bohemia."
  dvg_hre.1.a: "Sigismund will not be happy"

  dvg_hre.2.t: "The Great Fire of Nürnberg"
  dvg_hre.2.d: "The days that followed the tragedy were rife with finger-pointing. The aggrieved of Nürnberg cast theirs at a squad of Bohemians who'd set fire to a bakery after shooting everyone within : the Imperial Army denies such malice aforethought."
  dvg_hre.2.f: "Whichever the truth, its resulting facts lay clear in three quarters of a once-proud city in cinders, and thousands of charred corpses to come along with. While the good Duke Leopold nurses his wounds in Londres and his more conservative brother Hermann III bears the onerous task of rebuilding his capital, Sigismund returns to Prague having lit a fire not just in Nuremberg but in the heart of every German from the Danube to the Rhine."
  dvg_hre.2.a: "Let the city light our way to order."

  dvg_hre.3.t: "Das Nürnberglied"
  dvg_hre.3.d: "Tragedy has struck Nürmberg. Bohemian Soldiers have been accused to set fire to the city of Nürnberg. Das Nürnberglied, the Nuremberg Song, is an anthem written by Gottfried Wilhelm Eisler as a reaction to the Great Fire of Nürnberg."
  dvg_hre.3.f: "The first line, ”Deutsches Blut, geflossen in der kalten Nacht” (”German blood was shed in the cold night”), was an appeal to the various German monarchs to give the creation of a constitution that respects the individual human a higher priority than the independence of their small states. In the third stanza, with a call for ”Gleichheit, Einheit, Freiheit” (equality, unity, freedom), Eisler expressed his desire for a united and free Germany where the rule of law, not monarchical arbitrariness, would prevail. Due to the contemporary tense atmosphere, many liberals and intellectuals have began to use these three words as a campaigning slogan against the lacking guarantee of rights for the people."
  dvg_hre.3.a: "A dream reborn."
