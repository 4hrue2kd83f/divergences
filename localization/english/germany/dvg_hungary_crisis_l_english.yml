  dvg_hungary_crisis.2.t: "The Saxon Inheritance"
  dvg_hungary_crisis.2.d: "After the Great German War and the subsequent peace treaties, the Ernestine duchies signed the Erfurt Agreement of 1823. This prevented further partitioning and laid clear guidelines for the division of land should a ducal line be extinguished. However, all lines survived and the agreement was revised. This new agreement created the 'confederation' of Ducal Saxony. All duchies are sovereign but their laws and taxes are synchronized, a central government was set up to administer the whole region, and a new unitary flag was created for the state. Saxe-Meiningen-Eisenach was excluded from several clauses of the Erfurt Agreement due to perceived exceptionalism and its special tax rights. Now that its economy has stagnated, it wants to join. With the Ernestine duchies now fully reunited, the dukes intend to reorganize the confederation under the banner of the old Duchy of Thuringia whose partitioning created the duchies in the first place. However the Emperor may force us to accept his personal “protection” in exchange for approving this."

Saxe-Meiningen-Eisenach was excluded from several clauses of the Erfurt Agreement due to its unique laws but its economic stagnation has caused it to seek renegotiation. The dukes intend to reorganize under the banner of the old Duchy of Thuringia, their titular ancestor, but we may want to force them to accept special Imperial protection to keep them loyal.#R  We must remember that the Treaty of Paris curtailed Imperial authority. From this moment on, whenever we intervene in our Imperial Estates, we will be increasing the risk of a new Great German War. #!"

  dvg_hungary_crisis.4.t: "The Riots in Bremen"
  dvg_hungary_crisis.4.d: "The Scandinavian garrison of the Free Imperial City of Bremen has long been loathed by Bremeners, ever since the ousting of Dahlkist mayor Caspar Thiele during the Imperial Revolutions. Long gone are the days of the controversial, half-Nordic, yet still popular mayor Hermann von Lettow, who, despite inviting Scandinavian forces to the city, managed to spare Bremen from much of the Great German War and secure its independence during the Paris Peace Congress as one of the few delegates from an Imperial Free City. His successor Walther Raschen inspires no such love from the citizenry, who now see Bremen as an occupied territory. The government's fear of prosecuting Scandinavian soldiers' crimes has given rise to independent citizen militias. These militias, demanding the resignation of Raschen and the immediate expulsion of Scandinavian troops, are now rioting the Marktplatz and several small fires have already been ignited by their attacks. Rachen in turn has demanded that the Scandinavians help the city guard restore order…"

  dvg_hungary_crisis.5.t: "The Bremen Affair"
  dvg_hungary_crisis.5.d: "We occupied the Imperial Free City of Bremen during the Imperial Revolutions at the request of German-Scandinavian aristocrat Hermann von Lettow, ousting Dahlkist mayor Caspar Thiele. But von Lettow died in office and was replaced by the reactionary Walther Raschen. Repeated accusations have been made that the Bremen courts are afraid to charge our troops (despite the Treaty of Paris which ended the Great German War permitting our garrison to only use force in self-defense). In turn, independent citizen militias have formed. Recently they converged upon the Markplatz, where they first demanded Raschen's resignation and the expulsion of our troops, then began to riot, threatening to set the city ablaze. Our soldiers, at Raschen's request, violently put down the mob. Now Copenhagen papers speak of the “Bremen Massacre,” allowing the liberals to paint the Unionsters as barbarians. The Elbian Germans across the realm are now protesting, denouncing us as occupiers, and martial law has been declared in Bremen, Holstein, and Pomerania."

  dvg_hungary_crisis.6.t: "The Bremen Massacre"
  dvg_hungary_crisis.6.d: "Scandinavia has occupied the Free Imperial City of Bremen ever since they ousted Dahlkist mayor Caspar Thiele during the Imperial Revolutions. This was at the request of his replacement, the controversial, half-Nordic, yet still popular Hermann von Lettow, who managed to spare Bremen from much of the Great German War and secure its independence during the Paris Peace Congress as one of the few delegates from an Imperial Free City. His successor was the reactionary Walther Raschen. Rumors that the Bremener courts would not prosecute Nordic soldiers gave rise to independent citizen militias. These militias staged a riot in the Marktplatz to demand the resignation of Raschen and the expulsion of Scandinavian troops. Raschen summoned the Scandinavians, and the garrison shot and beat the crowd into submission. Scandinavia has placed their own German territories under martial law. Needless to say, use of force against Imperial citizens by the garrison was forbidden by the Treaty of Paris except in self-defense."

  dvg_hungary_crisis.7.t: "The Schwerin Clash"
  dvg_hungary_crisis.7.d: "Ever since the 17th century, the United Kingdom of Scandinavia and Scotland has held the duchies of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Pomerania, despite both officially lying within the Empire. Over the years, Scandinavia's administration has led to the term “Pomerania” starting to encompass the whole territory. However, the ancient House of Mecklenburg still survives in the cadet branch of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, who still cling to their last county with Imperial protection. Now the Bremen Massacre and the resulting imposition of martial law by Scandinavia has sparked clashes throughout Mecklenburg. The violence has even spread to the Schwerin border, with Germans on both sides demanding the reunification of the Duchy and the removal of all Scandinavian influence from northern Germany. Scandinavia's grip on the Ostsee coast appears weaker than ever before, something that we should look to exploit in our quest to reunify the Empire."
