  je_treaty_of_paris: "The Treaty of Paris"
  je_treaty_of_paris_reason: "The Treaty of Paris is an agreement made by the Great Powers of Europe after the Great German War. It basically restored the Holy Roman Empire but limited the Power of the Kaiser. In this Treaty the Powers of Europe agreed to not intevene in Wars regarding the Holy Roman Empire. This boils down to:\n\n#Bold Scandinavia, Burgundy, Bohemia and the Dual Monarchy are not allowed to declare wars on Members of the Holy Roman Empire.#!\n\n If they would todo so it would greatly benefit their opponent.\n\n#N Gameplay warning: It is not advised to declare a regular war against the HRE at this point. Events that declare wars are an exception to this.#!"
