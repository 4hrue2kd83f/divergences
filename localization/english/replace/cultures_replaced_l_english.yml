 #Note about Italians:
 #Feel free to disagree, but I never liked the whole "North German" "North Italian" "South Italian" ect thing. The reason why is becuase that's not really how the cultures works in OTL and even in DOD lore iirc
 #As such I think Tuscan and Neapolian make far more sence for nameing here. Neapolians have spread alot more due to the power of Aragon, and Tuscan becuase Provence used to be the King of some of Northen Italy in lore. 
 #DOD does a better job with all the different German cultures, which is really cool. If anyone has better ideas for names let me know as I am open ears. 
 #I say keep North Italian and South Italian, they are abstractions, whereas Tuscan and Neapolitan mean specific things. Calling north italian tuscan is incredibly silly, since Tuscany as a region is far smaller. Neapolitan is also silly, but at least has some historical precedence with the Neapolitan kingdom. With that said, the real life spread of neapolitan culture is far smaller than the region of South italian. So for now, keeping them as is.
