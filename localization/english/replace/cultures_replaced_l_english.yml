 #Note about Italians:
 #Feel free to disagree, but I never liked the whole "North German" "North Italian" "South Italian" ect thing. The reason why is becuase that's not really how the cultures works in OTL and even in DOD lore iirc
 #As such I think Tuscan and Neapolian make far more sence for nameing here. Neapolians have spread alot more due to the power of Aragon, and Tuscan becuase Provence used to be the King of some of Northen Italy in lore. 
 #DOD does a better job with all the different German cultures, which is really cool. If anyone has better ideas for names let me know as I am open ears.
