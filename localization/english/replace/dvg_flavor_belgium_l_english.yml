 je_seven_sisters_reason: "As it currently stands, the Belgian republics are divided on how they would be governed if they were to be united country."
 belgian_formed_tt: "The Belgian Confederacy has formed."

 je_sanacomie: "Sanacomie Question"
 je_sanacomie_reason: "During the Belgian Revolution, the Plantagenians were able to keep control most of southern Arcadia, with their northern border being the Sanacomie region. However, the town of Vierset was successfully held onto by the Belgians and it remains in this position to this day."


 je_belgian_confederacy: "The Belgian Confederacy"
 je_belgian_confederacy_reason: "Although Belgium has formally united as a single country - it is still vulnerable to division on a state level. Should the country lose wars, declared bankruptcy, or be unable to reconcile its competing interest groups, it may very well go back to its divided state."

 je_cbv_monarchy_reason: "As mob rule and republican order have come crashing down, it is time to rally behind the tried and true form of government."

 dvg_belgium.1.t: "The Seven Republics of New Burgundy"
 dvg_belgium.1.d: "Ever since our independence the “Seven Sisters” have struggled both amongst one another and against our neighbors. The Seven Republics remain aloof from one another, currently only bound by the Articles of Confederation. This document sheltered us through the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetAdjective] storm but it has not made us a true nation. "
 dvg_belgium.1.f: "We began as a Burgundian colony conquered by the Dual Monarchy in the 18th century. [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetName] sought to absorb us into their abominable Arcadian Empire but the glorious Belgian Revolution broke their chains and secured our freedom. For this reason a constitutional convention has been called in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] where for weeks delegates have been crafting the foundation of a new united nation. Its prospective name is the “Belgian Confederacy” named for the ancient lands of Belgica whose fierce natives warred against the Romans and from which many of our settlers’ ancestors hail from..."
 dvg_belgium.1.a: "Nous le Peuple afin de former une union plus parfaite."

 dvg_belgium.2.t: "The Nouvèl Flande Constitutional Convention"
 dvg_belgium.2.d: "The conference to establish the founding document of the Belgian Confederacy is proceeding at pace. While it is far from finished unification of the Seven Republics currently seems inevitable."
 dvg_belgium.2.f: "As [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_CNF').GetAdjective] ’s capital city of Nouvelle Bruges has been selected as our new national capital they seem poised to take the lead of our new union."
 dvg_belgium.2.a: "Reject their demand"
 dvg_belgium.2.b: "Surrender control"

 dvg_belgium.3.t: "The Situation in Sanacomie"
 dvg_belgium.3.d: "During our revolution against the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetAdjective]  menace the brave Louisianais of eastern [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetName] joined forces with the Seven Republics. However the royalist army was able to reconquer nearly all of Louisiane – only Vierset a town in the Sanacomie region was able to be saved."
 dvg_belgium.3.f: "The upcoming Arcadian Conference arranged by the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('roosters_ig').GetName] (also known as the "Brabantians") in Vierset will attempt to determine a more permanent border between our nations and whether Vierset belongs to our Confederation. While we do not wish to see blood shed over the issue few of our politicians believe that the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetAdjective]  will negotiate in good faith and there is a widespread expectation that the conference will fail..."
 dvg_belgium.3.a: "We shall try our best regardless."

 dvg_belgium.4.t: "The Arcadian Conference"
 dvg_belgium.4.d: "As expected the conference was a total debacle. The [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetAdjective]  repeatedly accused us of attempting to legitimize our “illegal occupation” of Vierset and refused to even consider abandoning their claim to the province."
 dvg_belgium.4.f: "Moreover, our own delegation was a disorganized jumble of seven politicians – one from each republic – struggling to express a coherent message. They were further divided between the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('roosters_ig').GetName], the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('lions_ig').GetName]  (isolationists) and the Burgundian League (expansionists). The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('roosters_ig').GetName] drew criticism as angling to use the Sanacomie issue to claim more power and sell more weapons to the Seven Republics. Barely heard above the din were the Louisianais who were themselves outraged that the Seven Republics had “abandoned” them and were now contemplating returning Vierset to [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetName]. The conference ended in bitter recrimination and many are blaming the high-handed [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('roosters_ig').GetName] for sabotaging the situation and not being more democratic..."
 dvg_belgium.4.a: "We need to stand together against the Plantagenian threat!"
 dvg_belgium.4.b: "Maybe we should send only one delegation next time..."

 dvg_belgium.5.t: "The Tenth Session of the Constitutional Convention"
 dvg_belgium.5.d: "The constitutional convention has been a hopeless back and forth since the end of the war against [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetName]'s' hideous “Arcadian Empire.” It has been paralyzed between the “Three Leagues.” "
 dvg_belgium.5.f: "The  [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('lions_ig').GetName] also known as the “Lions” want a unitary Belgium with a weak president and are isolationists. The Burgundian League or the “Crosses” want a federal Belgium with a strong president who can lead them to victory against the Plantagentians. There is also the fringe Brabantian League also known as the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('roosters_ig').GetName] or the “Old Arcadians” which are a minor faction that espouse pan-Arcadianism. They are small but have rich friends whose appetite for wealth and power has been described as “rivaling Crassus.” They tend to align with the Burgundians but also favor a unitary state. The latest debate is about the central role of the government. The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('roosters_ig').GetName] believe that only a strong Stadtholder can defend Belgium but they have been accused of angling for a dictatorship. Many others want more democratic safeguards."
 dvg_belgium.5.a: "The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('roosters_ig').GetName] are right - we need strength!"
 dvg_belgium.5.b: "The Burgundians persuade the room to uphold liberty"
 dvg_belgium.5.c: "The Calvinists of the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('lions_ig').GetName]  rally around pacifism."


 dvg_belgium.6.t: "Anti-Cadien Protests!"
 dvg_belgium.6.d: "News of the failure of the Arcadian Conference has stoked the flames of rage against [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetName]. Cities across the Seven Republics have seen demonstrations calling for war against the south demanding that we liberate the Louisianais from their debased servitude to Nouvelle-France."
 dvg_belgium.6.f: "The largest demonstration of all has been staged in Nouvelle Bruges right outside of the convention! Crowds waved unofficial versions of the proposed Belgian flag along with the banners of the Seven Republics and the old battle standard of the revolutionary Louisianais Republic. Their passionate and irate calls for retribution against the Cadiens have animated many delegates to overcome their hesitation and produce a constitution as soon as possible."
 dvg_belgium.6.a: "War is good for some things it seems..."
 dvg_belgium.6.b: "These protests need to be broken up."


 dvg_belgium.7.t: "The Unification of the Belgian Confederacy"
 dvg_belgium.7.d: "Alas, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] republics have united into a single nation."
 dvg_belgium.7.f: "We the People of the Seven Republics in Order to form a more perfect Union establish justice insure domestic tranquility provide for the common defense promote the general welfare and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity do ordain and establish this Constitution for the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName].” – Preamble to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] Constitution\n\nWhen New Burgundy won its freedom from the Cadien-ruled Arcadian Empire some thought it would shatter and that its republics would go their separate ways. Yet the Seven Sisters have remained under one roof and confirmed the solidarity of their family. The Belgian Constitution has finally been finished and signed and has gone out to the Seven Republics for ratification. While many rejoice at the unification of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] our admittance of Vierset as the “Vierset Territory” has provoked outrage in [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetName]. The newly unified Belgian armed forces may soon undergo a trial by fire."
 dvg_belgium.7.a: "In the name of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], we defy the world!"

 dvg_belgium.8.t: "The Belgian Destiny"
 dvg_belgium.8.d: "Alas, the Belgian republics are on their way to unite into a single nation."
 dvg_belgium.8.f: "The day of unification has finally come : the Belgian constitution has been finalized and signed by our delegation to Nouvelle Bruges. All that remains now is its ratification. As the representatives of our state legislature read it over hear its preamble echoing through the chamber as read out by the Spreker an aura of confidence and hope fills the room. It is far from a perfect document – everyone agrees on that – but it is something new something bold something proud. It is a sacred promise of liberty and union. The vote itself is a mere formality."
 dvg_belgium.8.a: "Oui"
 dvg_belgium.8.b: "Non!"


 dvg_belgium.9.t: "Belgium has United!"
 dvg_belgium.9.d: "The Planteurs have often disparaged the Seven Republics confident that their attempts to build a unified democratic state were a doomed endeavor. The ratification of the  [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_BLC').GetAdjective]  constitution and the consolidation of the Seven Republics into a single nation has thoroughly disproved that notion."
 dvg_belgium.9.f: "While we would prefer to focus on our own affairs the  [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_BLC').GetAdjective]  admittance of the illegally occupied Plantagenian province of Vierset as the “Vierset Territory” has ignited a firestorm of anti-[SCOPE.sCountry('scope_BLC').GetAdjective]  sentiment. This is a direct threat to our territorial integrity! If we allow it to go unchallenged then we would be condoning the annexation of our lands and who knows where that might lead? Already the east coast has seen a sharp resurgence of Louisianais nationalism with the small landholders hopeful that the Belgians might aid their cause. This is the beginning of a crisis."
 dvg_belgium.9.a: "Sanacomie has been and always will be [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetAdjective]!"

 dvg_belgium.10.t: "The Sanacomie Crisis"
 dvg_belgium.10.d: "The inclusion of Vierset within the unified Belgian nation has infuriated the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetAdjective]s. By officially confirming our annexation of the province we have given hope to the Louisianais nationalists we have given hope to the Louisianais nationalists."
 dvg_belgium.10.f: "Already several Louisianais groups within [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetName] have begun agitating for independence and the Planteurs (Plantagenian slaveowning nobles) accuse us of orchestrating them. Furthermore the Plantagenian border has seen a notable increase in military activity. So far no incursions have been made but both Belgian and Plantagenian militias have made public remarks alluding to “foraging missions” which may soon commence. This is a serious matter but both of our nations remember the carnage of the Belgian Revolution and are not eager to repeat it. There may be further buildup before the eruption of this crisis"
 dvg_belgium.10.a: "When it does erupt, it shall echo across Arcadia."
 dvg_belgium.10.b: "The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('lions_ig').GetName]  convinces the States-General to seek mediation!"

 dvg_belgium.11.t: "A Mediation Conference in Porto Dandolo?"
 dvg_belgium.11.d: "We have received an unexpected offer from the wicked [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_BLC').GetAdjective]s. The threat of war over Vierset has alarmed them and they wish to attempt a diplomatic resolution to the crisis. They have offered to convene a meeting in the neutral [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VEN').GetAdjective] colony of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_ATH').GetName] at Porto Dandolo to resolve the Sanacomie Crisis without bloodshed."
 dvg_belgium.11.f: "Most are dismissive of this overture viewing it as a mere trick but several wealthy [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('planteurs_ig').GetName] are concerned about the loss of profits but several wealthy Planteurs are concerned about the loss of profi – er"
 dvg_belgium.11.a: "Shout the insolent [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_BLC').GetAdjective] diplomat out of the foreign office!"
 dvg_belgium.11.b: "This will be interesting."

 dvg_belgium.12.t: "[SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetName] Refuses Mediation"
 dvg_belgium.12.d: "[SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetName] has completely rejected any attempts at diplomacy. "
 dvg_belgium.12.f: "Our representative in Nouvelle-France received a sharp rebuke from the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetAdjective] foreign minister who denounced our “trampling of the rights of a sovereign nation” and condemned our offer of mediation as a farce! The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('lions_ig').GetName]  has been publicly humiliated by the failure of their peace overtures while the Burgundians and the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('roosters_ig').GetName] gear up for the battle to come..."
 dvg_belgium.12.a: "At least we can say that we gave peace a chance!"

 dvg_belgium.13.t: "Porto Dandolo Conference"
 dvg_belgium.13.d: "The conference with [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetName] in Porto Dandolo has turned out to be less successful than anticipated."
 dvg_belgium.13.f: "The mood in Porto Dandolo was unpleasant long before the meeting began. While choosing this location for the conference may have ensured that neither side held an advantage its oppressive heat and humidity soured everyone’s moods. The conference itself was even worse. The [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetAdjective]s absolutely refused to recognize our sovereignty over Vierset demanding its immediate “return”, and furthermore blaming us for “inciting insurrection” in Louisiane. Our own delegates attempted to be patient with them but they finally grew tired of the  [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetAdjective]s’ antics and presented an ultimatum : surrender Sanacomie – the entire region – to us or face war. It seems that the Old Arcadian and the Burgundian Leagues had made a secret agreement to authorize our delegation to make this threat if negotiations deadlocked. The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('lions_ig').GetName]  is furious but now we can only wait for their reaction"
 dvg_belgium.13.a: "But I thought this was the era of diplomacy and etiquette…"

 dvg_belgium.14.t: "The Belgian Ultimatum"
 dvg_belgium.14.d: "The conference with [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetName] in Porto Dandolo has turned out to be less successful than anticipated."
 dvg_belgium.14.f: "We went to Porto Dandolo in good faith despite the heat and humidity of the locale but the Belgians proved unwilling to listen to reason. They ignored every attempt that we made to explain our rights to Vierset dismissing any pretense of the inviolable nature of our national sovereignty. Soon enough they showed their true colors and demanded that we surrender the entirety of Sanacomie to them! Our own diplomats have requested permission to terminate the conference and return home unless we wish to make a counter-demand and insist on the return of Vierset. Capitulating to the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_BLC').GetAdjective]s could have dire consequencesboth for our government and our national stability...."
 dvg_belgium.14.a: "Yes lets end this farce and recall our diplomats!"
 dvg_belgium.14.b: "One good ultimatum deserves another! Demand Vierset!"
 dvg_belgium.14.c: "We cannot risk war!"


 dvg_belgium.15.t: "The Plantagenian Response"
 dvg_belgium.15.d: "In answer to our own ultimatum the Cadiens have given us one of their own : return Vierset immediately and forfeit any claims on it and the rest of eastern Plantagenia or face war!"
 dvg_belgium.15.f: "The failure of the conference appears imminent and many believe that the time has come to terminate this endeavor and prepare for inevitable conflict. Capitulating to the Plantagenians could have dire consequences both for our government and our national stability..."
 dvg_belgium.15.a: "What a waste of time this was."
 dvg_belgium.15.b: "Surely peace is worth a single province?"

 dvg_belgium.16.t: "Failure of the Porto Dandolo Conference"
 dvg_belgium.16.d: "As most Planteurs expected, negotiations with the Belgians have broken down. They rejected any possibility of returning Vierset and both of our delegations returned home in frustration."
 dvg_belgium.16.f: "The pro-peace Planteurs have been publicly humiliated by this disgrace and war between our nations now appears inevitable"
 dvg_belgium.16.a: "We gave peace a chance. It didn’t work..."

 dvg_belgium.17.t: "Failure of the Porto Dandolo Conference"
 dvg_belgium.17.d: "As the Burgundian and the Old Arcadian Leagues expected negotiations with the Plantagenians have broken down. They rejected any possibility of returning Sanacomie or even recognizing our possession of Vierset and both of our delegations returned home in frustration."
 dvg_belgium.17.f: The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('lions_ig').GetName]  has been publicly humiliated by this disgrace and war between our nations now appears inevitable..."
 dvg_belgium.17.a: "We gave peace a chance. It didn’t work..."


 dvg_belgium.18.t: "The Admission of Vierset"
 dvg_belgium.18.d: "The province of Vierset was originally admitted to the Belgian Confederacy as the “Vierset Territory” an ambiguous name to reflect its ambiguous status. Now that war with Plantagenia over the region appears certain we have decided to formally admit the territory as a full state."
 dvg_belgium.18.f: The only question is how exactly this should be done. The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('lions_ig').GetName]  believes that it should be admitted under the name of the “State of Sanacomie” reflecting the legitimacy of our claim to the rest of the region. The Burgundians and the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('roosters_ig').GetName] however have presented a competing bill recognizing the “petition for annexation” by the Louisiane Republic! Whichever way we choose to admit Vierset into the Confederation will be taken as a public signal of our aims in the war. Attempting to claim all of Louisiane may be beyond our abilities and could result in a negative outcome..."
 dvg_belgium.18.a: "Seven sisters shall become eight!"
 dvg_belgium.18.b: "All Louisiane shall fly the Belgian flag!"


 dvg_belgium.19.t: "Fausse Guerre"
 dvg_belgium.19.d: "While hostilities between the Belgian Confederacy and the Kingdom of Plantagenia are broiling they have yet to formally escalate to war."
 dvg_belgium.19.f: The Belgians seem to have armed Louisianais partisans in the hopes of either instigating a Louisianais revolution or at least hampering our own war effort when conflict eventually breaks out. We shall have to tackle this issue before confronting the Confederacy on the battlefield. §BIf we have not expended too many resources elsewhere – such as in Cymrie or the southwestern Great Lakes – then we stand a good chance of succeeding."
 dvg_belgium.19.a: "Mere distractions...nothing more."

 dvg_belgium.20.t: "Decisive Victory over the Louisianais Partisans!"
 dvg_belgium.20.d: "Louisianais guerillas were plotting to take over state governments and defect to the Belgians' cause, but have failed to do so."
 dvg_belgium.20.f: "The Louisianais guerillas have been crushed! With our comfortable reserves of resources and manpower we were able to divert sufficient forces into the eastern lands to root out the traitors and disarm them. Mounted patrols kept us informed of attacks and allowed us to intercept several partisan forces while they were in transit between bases. We were even able to induce some Catholic priests to give sermons in the region denouncing the Protestant Belgians stressing that if the Louisianais were to throw their lot in with the northerners they would be even worse off than before. These efforts have not eliminated Louisianais separatism but the threat of an armed insurrection collaborating with the Belgians has been ended..."
 dvg_belgium.20.a: "One less thing to worry about."


 dvg_belgium.21.t: "Constantin Leclère"
 dvg_belgium.21.d: "A celebrity commander has been making waves."
 dvg_belgium.21.f: "A young Planteur who has purchased a military commission has caught the attention of our high command. Constantin Leclère is a dashing and handsome figure with a short yet impressive record. In addition to participating in numerous raids on the natives he has served overseas with distinction in the Anglois Armée Royale. While he had been making plans to travel west with his brother Armand and establish a plantation in Cymrie the escalation of tensions with the Belgian Confederacy has instead caused him to enroll in the army as an officer. Leclère is a tall and powerfully built man with a bold forceful attitude and no small number of female admirers. If even half of the rumors of his conduct against the Indians and his service with the Anglois are true then he may have a keen grasp of strategy and tactics."
 dvg_belgium.21.a: "This man needs an army to command!"

 dvg_belgium.22.t: "Setback with the Louisianais Partisans"
 dvg_belgium.22.d: "Despite our best efforts we have not been able to fully eradicate the Louisianais guerillas."
 dvg_belgium.22.f: "We have identified several weapons caches arrested some notable leaders of the movement and foiled multiple plots to attack military forts and depots. This has reduced the danger posed by these partisans but not ended it. Patrols continue to report occasional harassing fire from the woods and several local politicians are believed to be corresponding with the Belgian government though nothing can be proven. We simply do not have the resources to fully root out all the guerillas in a timely manner. Our efforts against the Belgians will be made somewhat more difficult by all this."
 dvg_belgium.22.a: "Mission accomplished?"

 dvg_belgium.23.t: "Decisive Defeat against the Louisianais Partisans!"
 dvg_belgium.23.d: "Louisiane is in chaos. With our resources stretched thin across multiple areas we have not been able to make much progress at all against the guerillas."
 dvg_belgium.23.f: "Our forces moving through the east are constantly harried by fire from the woodlands local militias have refused to cooperate with the royal army and we have had to impose martial law across Louisiane. Even foreign sailors docking in eastern ports have grown noticeably wary of venturing too far into the cities for fear of being swept up in yet another outbreak of violent unrest. The only bright spot in all of this is that the clamor of Louisianais nationalism has somewhat drowned out abolitionism in the east as the white smallholders are prioritizing their own freedom over that of the slaves. When the Belgians come they shall find no lack of support"
 dvg_belgium.23.a: "Que Dieu punisse la Belgique!"
 dvg_belgium.23.b: "Nothing we can do about this..."


 dvg_belgium.24.t: "Military High Command Proposes a Lightning Offensive"
 dvg_belgium.24.d: "Our generals have drawn up plans for the invasion of Plantagenia. Currently their favored approach is a quick seizure of Sanacomie before consolidating our gains and pressing further south if conditions are right."
 dvg_belgium.24.f: " By attacking as soon as possible without giving the Plantagenians too much time to redirect their forces eastward we can catch them at minimal readiness. The risks of such a plan are twofold. First if our generals have overestimated our own preparedness then we might rush to war without the resources to sustain prolonged operations. Second if the Plantagenians are counting on drawing us into an extended defensive campaign pressing the attack so rapidly will only play into their hands. The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('roosters_ig').GetName] and most of the Burgundians want to strike now but the Dutch and a vocal Burgundian minority favor a small delay to finalize our preparations."
 dvg_belgium.24.a: "Cry "Havoc!" and let slip the dogs of war!"
 dvg_belgium.24.b: "Attacking so soon would be foolhardy continue our preparations."


 dvg_belgium.25.t: "The Battle of Fort Villefranche"
 dvg_belgium.25.d: "A company of militiamen from Base-Valoisy recently decided to carry out a “reconnaissance in force” near the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetAdjective] border."
 dvg_belgium.25.f: "Whether or not they intended to cross said border they soon ended up in Cadien territory and encountered a military base named Fort Villefranche. The fort’s sentries saw them as the militiamen were trying to verify whether it was [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] or [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetAdjective] – there was heavy rain and the fort’s flag was not clearly visible. A group of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetAdjective] soldiers came out to confront them and what happened next is disputed. The survivors of the militia swear that they were leaving only for the Cadiens to attack them as they fled. Newspapers in [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetName] allege that the Base-Valoisais attacked the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetAdjective] and then tried to assault the fort itself before being driven off by its cannons. The truth may never be known but what matters now is that this incident has forced our hand – our war with the Cadiens has already begun."
 dvg_belgium.25.a: "Alea iacta est!"
 
 dvg_belgium.26.t: "Victory over the Belgians!"
 dvg_belgium.26.d: "The mighty Armée Royale has shattered our enemies! Despite the efforts of the Belgians to launch a Louisianais partisan offensive in tandem with their invasion neither effort brought them success."
 dvg_belgium.26.f: " The Belgians were not only forced out of our own lands but suffered defeat after defeat as we marched through the Confederacy. Facing further humiliation their Stadtholder agreed to peace. The resulting treaty has seen Vierset restored to us and the Belgians have been forced to forsake any future attempts to lay claim to any part of Louisiane. Furthermore all assistance to Louisiane nationalists by the Belgians has ended. Some are bitter that we did not make further gains but if the reports of mass protests in Nouvelle Bruges are anything to go by then our victory may have irreversibly fractured the foundation of the Belgian Confederacy."
 dvg_belgium.26.a: "God really did save the South!"
 
 dvg_belgium.27.t: "Victory over the Plantagenians!"
 dvg_belgium.27.d: "The invincible Armée Confédérée has triumphed over our enemies! Despite the efforts of the Plantagenians to strangle the Louisianais spirit in tandem with their defense we persevered. The Cadiens suffered defeat after defeat as we marched through the Kingdom."
 dvg_belgium.27.f: "After our Stadtholder threatened to ignite a second Louisianais revolution their ruler and their bloated Planteurs agreed to peace. The resulting treaty has seen Vierset reunited with the rest of Sanacomie and all Plantagenian claims to the region permanently forfeited. The people rejoice at the Confederacy’s victory and the unbreakable solidarity of our nation has been cemented."
 dvg_belgium.27.a: "Three rousing cheers for the Confederacy"


 dvg_belgium.28.t: "The Vote of No Confidence"
 dvg_belgium.28.d: "Following recent losses, the stadtholder was ousted."
 dvg_belgium.28.f: "The failure to aquire Louisiane, Sanacomie, or the Western territories could not be readily explained in or to the States-General. No amount of adroit speechcraft by the Stadtholder or any of his political allies could satisfy the legislature’s outrage at the loss of the territory whose liberation was our reason for waging war against the Cadiens. It soon became apparent that they didn’t want mere answers – they wanted heads to roll. This morning a vote of no confidence was held. "
 dvg_belgium.28.a: "Losing the Stadtholder was bad, but at least it couldn't get any worse?"
 
 dvg_belgium.29.t: "Western Seccession"
 dvg_belgium.29.d: "The Belgian Confederacy is on its way to collapse."
 dvg_belgium.29.f: " "There was an assumption of the equality of races entertained by leading statesmen at the time of the formation of the old Constitution. It was a sandy foundation as was the idea of a Government built upon it. When the ‘storm came and the wind blew it fell.’ The foundations of our new government are laid its cornerstone rests upon the fact that neither the negro nor the Indian are equal to the white man - that subordination to the superior race is inevitable. This our new government is the first in the history of the world based upon this self-evident truth. The other republics have betrayed this truth and plunged daggers into our backs. We shall suffer their abuses no longer.” – [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_CHV').GetAdjective] Grand Pensionary [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_CHV').GetRuler.GetName]  \n\n The dream of Liberty and Union has been murdered by the Seven Sisters’ vendettas. This morning the Burgundians from [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_CHV').GetName] and [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_CFS').GetName] withdrew to their home states which have both declared secession. This is the beginning of a crisis but the worst may be yet to come. "
 dvg_belgium.29.a: "Bell horrida bella et Thybrim multo spumantem sanguine cerno…"
 dvg_belgium.29.b: "[SCOPE.sCountry('scope_CHV').GetName] is what's "hot" right now!"
 dvg_belgium.29.c: "[SCOPE.sCountry('scope_CFS').GetName] is the superior place to be!"


 dvg_belgium.30.t: "The Declaration of a State of Emergency"
 dvg_belgium.30.d: "Following recent events, a state of emergency has been declared in Belgium."
 dvg_belgium.30.f: " “Article 20 : In the event of a State not fulfilling the duties imposed upon it by the Constitution or if public security is clearly endangered the Stadtholder may take measures necessary to restore law and order intervening if need be with the aid of the armed forces. For this purpose he may suspend for a while in whole or in part the rights provided in Articles 1,3,4,5,8 and 9.The Stadtholder must inform the States-General without delay of all measures taken in accordance with this Article. These measures are to be revoked on the demand of the States-General…” – The Belgian Constitution\n\nThe Old Arcadians have made their move. Our crisis has allowed them with the support of their rich backers to maneuver their candidate shipping baron Gerhard Monfried into the stadtholdership. He has promptly invoked Article 20. For all intents and purposes Belgium is no longer a democracy..."
 dvg_belgium.30.a: "Belgium is no longer a democracy..."

 dvg_belgium.31.f: " “Resolved, that  in light of the public danger posed to the aforesaid States it is recommended to their Legislatures to pass laws authorizing the Grand Pensionaries or Commanders in Chief of their militia to make detachments from the same or to form voluntary corps as shall be most suitable to their Constitutions and to cause the same to be well armed equipped and disciplined and held in readiness for service : and upon the request of the Grand Pensionary of either of the other States to employ the whole of such units as well as the regular forces of the State in assisting the State making such request to repel any invasion thereof which shall be made or attempted…” – The Espérance Declaration\n\nThe Dutch League was outraged by the Old Arcadians’ seizure of power. They may not have had the resources to stop it but they were determined to resist. Now [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_CCA').GetName] and [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_CPH').GetName] the Dutch heartland have both declared their intent to defend themselves against the confederal government effectively seceding..."

 dvg_belgium.32.t: "The Tyranny of Duke Alexandre I"
 dvg_belgium.32.d: "Following recent events, a state of emergency has been declared in Belgium."
 dvg_belgium.32.f: " “The republican order is crashing down. Never has such evidence been given of the weakness of democracy. This those in antiquity knew. Did Athens not crumble in the face of Macedon? Did Rome not take up the imperial laurel? We have inherited all the old flaws of republicanism. The only way to shed them is to cast off the whole shell. Like the phoenix we emerge from the ashes of death into the bloom of life : that we do so resting upon the ancient principles of rulership is natural.” – Duke Alexandre I of Base-Valoisy\n\nThroughout our struggles one promise was held sacred : opposition to monarchical rule. That vow has now been blasphemed. Grand Pensionary Alexandre Saftleven of Base-Valoisy has crowned himself Duke of the region and now rules the land as his private fief. §RThe remaining Belgians are now ready to make any sacrifice to obliterate this scourge from the earth. The Stadtholder’s reaction to this news spoke for us all."
 dvg_belgium.32.a: "[SCOPE.sCountry('scope_CBV').GetName] shall be burned to the ground!"
 dvg_belgium.32.b: "God save the duke of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_CBV').GetName]!"

 dvg_belgium.33.t: "Sic Semper Tyrannis"
 dvg_belgium.33.d: "Basse Valoisie has been annexed and the reign of their duke has ended."
 dvg_belgium.33.f: " It is done. Base-Valoisy has been righteously punished. Not since the harrowing of the Albigensians has such slaughter as we have unleashed upon Base-Valoisy been seen amongst the children of the Franks. The capture of the false Duke was best of all. Hauled back to Nouvelle Bruges he was convicted of treason hanged in front of the Stadtholder’s residence and his body then preserved and shipped back to Base-Valoisy. From there it was brought to the Plantagenian border and gibbeted in sight of a Cadien fort! Let that Judas Iscariot be a testament to the fate of despots in Belgium. \n\n The vile traitors of Base-Valoisy foolishly believed that we would wallow in despair rather than deliver righteous vengeance upon them. Their profaning of the republican cause, however has rendered their annihilation necessary. Now we go forth to wipe the stain of Base-Valoisy from the face of the Earth. Forget any ridiculous prattle about the “Seven Sisters!” These disgusting vermin are no kin of ours. There is only one course of action which we must follow without straying, without ceasing until it's done."
 dvg_belgium.33.a: "Live free or die!"

 dvg_belgium.34.t: "God Save the King of New Burgundy"
 dvg_belgium.34.d: "Basse Valoisie has been annexed and the reign of their duke has ended."
 dvg_belgium.34.f: "That was a brilliant plan Your Majesty! Simply brilliant! Only you, my lord, could have known that the unwashed rabble of Nouvèl Flande and its ilk would’ve been so overcome with fury that they’d be blind to your stellar maneuvers! I mean that encirclement which you pulled off at the border was a thing of beauty! And the way in which you directed the cavalry cutting those ruffians down when they tried to flee – magnificent! Oh I do wish we’d had more time to plan the coronation but all things considered I believe it went rather well if I do say so myself Your Majesty. Watching that dreadful Stadtholder hung, drawn, and quartered and quartered was certainly a clever way to cap off the festivities. But my lord – and I know how busy you are now what with the royal court and negotiations with all those corporate men – I just want to know how did you know it all would work out? How did you know that the people needed not just a duke but a king and that they’d recognize you were the one to lead them – to lead us all?"
 dvg_belgium.34.a: "We are simply that good. Now, run along dear subject."

 dvg_belgium.35.t: "The New Burgundian Kingdom"
 dvg_belgium.35.d: "Now that Nouvelle Flandre has been vanquished, our majesty [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] has to make a decision on the country's future."
