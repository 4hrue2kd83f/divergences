 je_seven_sisters: "Divided Republics"
 je_seven_sisters_reason: "As it currently stands, the Belgian republics are divided on how they would be governed if they were to be united country."

 je_sanacomie: "Sanacomie Question"
 je_sanacomie_reason: "During the Belgian Revolution, the Plantagenians were able to keep control most of southern Arcadia, with their northern border being the Sanacomie region. However, the town of Vierset was successfully held onto by the Belgians and it remains in this position to this day. "

 dvg_belgium.1.t: "The Seven Republics of New Burgundy"
 dvg_belgium.1.d: "Ever since our independence the “Seven Sisters” have struggled both amongst one another and against our neighbors. The Seven Republics remain aloof from one another, currently only bound by the Articles of Confederation. This document sheltered us through the Plantagenian storm but it has not made us a true nation. "
 dvg_belgium.1.f: "We began as a Burgundian colony conquered by the Dual Monarchy in the 18th century. Plantagenia sought to absorb us into their abominable Arcadian Empire but the glorious Belgian Revolution broke their chains and secured our freedom. For this reason a constitutional convention has been called in Nouvèl Flande where for weeks delegates have been crafting the foundation of a new united nation. Its prospective name is the “Belgian Confederacy” named for the ancient lands of Belgica whose fierce natives warred against the Romans and from which many of our settlers’ ancestors hail from..."
 dvg_belgium.1.a: "Nous le Peuple afin de former une union plus parfaite."

 dvg_belgium.2.t: "The Nouvèl Flande Constitutional Convention"
 dvg_belgium.2.d: "The conference to establish the founding document of the Belgian Confederacy is proceeding at pace. While it is far from finished unification of the Seven Republics currently seems inevitable."
 dvg_belgium.2.f: "As Nouvèl Flandre’s capital city of Nouvelle Bruges has been selected as our new national capital they seem poised to take the lead of our new union."
 dvg_belgium.2.a: "Reject their demand"
 dvg_belgium.2.b: "Surrender control"

 dvg_belgium.3.t: "The Situation in Sanacomie"
 dvg_belgium.3.d: "During our revolution against the Plantagenian menace the brave Louisianais of eastern Plantagenia joined forces with the Seven Republics. However the royalist army was able to reconquer nearly all of Louisiane – only Vierset a town in the Sanacomie region was able to be saved."
 dvg_belgium.3.f: "The upcoming Arcadian Conference arranged by the Old Arcadian League (also known as the Brabantians and the “Roosters”) in Viersetwill attempt to determine a more permanent border between our nations and whether Vierset belongs to our Confederation. While we do not wish to see blood shed over the issue few of our politicians believe that the Plantagenians will negotiate in good faith and there is a widespread expectation that the conference will fail..."
 dvg_belgium.3.a: "We shall try our best regardless."

 dvg_belgium.4.t: "The Arcadian Conference"
 dvg_belgium.4.d: "As expected the conference was a total debacle. The Plantagenians repeatedly accused us of attempting to legitimize our “illegal occupation” of Vierset and refused to even consider abandoning their claim to the province."
 dvg_belgium.4.f: "Moreover, our own delegation was a disorganized jumble of seven politicians – one from each republic – struggling to express a coherent message. They were further divided between the Old Arcadian League the Dutch League (isolationists) and the Burgundian League (expansionists). The Old Arcadians drew criticism as angling to use the Sanacomie issue to claim more power and sell more weapons to the Seven Republics. Barely heard above the din were the Louisianais who were themselves outraged that the Seven Republics had “abandoned” them and were now contemplating returning Vierset to Plantagenia. The conference ended in bitter recrimination and many are blaming the high-handed Old Arcadians for sabotaging the situation and not being more democratic..."
 dvg_belgium.4.a: "We need to stand together against the Plantagenian threat!"
 dvg_belgium.4.b: "Maybe we should send only one delegation next time..."

 dvg_belgium.5.t: "The Tenth Session of the Constitutional Convention"
 dvg_belgium.5.d: "The constitutional convention has been a hopeless back and forth since the end of the war against Plantagenia’s hideous “Arcadian Empire.” It has been paralyzed between the “Three Leagues.” "
 dvg_belgium.5.f: "The Dutch League also known as the “Lions” want a unitary Belgium with a weak president and are isolationists. The Burgundian League or the “Crosses” want a federal Belgium with a strong president who can lead them to victory against the Plantagentians. There is also the fringe Brabantian League also known as the Old Arcadians or the “Roosters” which are a minor faction that espouse pan-Arcadianism. They are small but have rich friends whose appetite for wealth and power has been described as “rivaling Crassus.” They tend to align with the Burgundians but also favor a unitary state. The latest debate is about the central role of the government. The Old Arcadians believe that only a strong Stadtholder can defend Belgium but they have been accused of angling for a dictatorship. Many others want more democratic safeguards."
 dvg_belgium.5.a: "The Old Arcadians are right - we need strength!"
 dvg_belgium.5.b: "The Burgundians persuade the room to uphold liberty"
 dvg_belgium.5.c: "The Calvinists of the Dutch League rally around pacifism."


 dvg_belgium.6.t: "Anti-Cadien Protests!"
 dvg_belgium.6.d: "News of the failure of the Arcadian Conference has stoked the flames of rage against Plantagenia. Cities across the Seven Republics have seen demonstrations calling for war against the south demanding that we liberate the Louisianais from their debased servitude to Nouvelle-France."
 dvg_belgium.6.f: "The largest demonstration of all has been staged in Nouvelle Bruges right outside of the convention! Crowds waved unofficial versions of the proposed Belgian flag along with the banners of the Seven Republics and the old battle standard of the revolutionary Louisianais Republic. Their passionate and irate calls for retribution against the Cadiens have animated many delegates to overcome their hesitation and produce a constitution as soon as possible."
 dvg_belgium.6.a: "War is good for some things it seems..."
 dvg_belgium.6.b: "These protests need to be broken up."


 dvg_belgium.7.t: "The Unification of the Belgian Confederacy"
 dvg_belgium.7.d: "Alas, the Belgian republics have united into a single nation."
 dvg_belgium.7.f: "We the People of the Seven Republics in Order to form a more perfect Union establish justice insure domestic tranquility provide for the common defense promote the general welfare and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity do ordain and establish this Constitution for the Confederation of Belgium.” – Preamble to the Belgian Constitution\n\nWhen New Burgundy won its freedom from the Cadien-ruled Arcadian Empire some thought it would shatter and that its republics would go their separate ways. Yet the Seven Sisters have remained under one roof and confirmed the solidarity of their family. The Belgian Constitution has finally been finished and signed and has gone out to the Seven Republics for ratification. While many rejoice at the unification of the Belgian Confederacy our admittance of Vierset as the “Vierset Territory” has provoked outrage in Plantagenia. The newly unified Belgian armed forces may soon undergo a trial by fire."
 dvg_belgium.7.a: "In the name of Belgium, we defy the world!"

 dvg_belgium.8.t: "The Belgian Destiny"
 dvg_belgium.8.d: "Alas, the Belgian republics are on their way to unite into a single nation."
 dvg_belgium.8.f: "The day of unification has finally come : the Belgian constitution has been finalized and signed by our delegation to Nouvelle Bruges. All that remains now is its ratification. As the representatives of our state legislature read it over hear its preamble echoing through the chamber as read out by the Spreker an aura of confidence and hope fills the room. It is far from a perfect document – everyone agrees on that – but it is something new something bold something proud. It is a sacred promise of liberty and union. The vote itself is a mere formality."
 dvg_belgium.8.a: "Oui"
 dvg_belgium.8.b: "Non!"


 dvg_belgium.9.t: "Belgium has United!"
 dvg_belgium.9.d: "The Planteurs have often disparaged the Seven Republics confident that their attempts to build a unified democratic state were a doomed endeavor. The ratification of the Belgian constitution and the consolidation of the Seven Republics into a single nation has thoroughly disproved that notion."
 dvg_belgium.9.f: "While we would prefer to focus on our own affairs the Belgian admittance of the illegally occupied Plantagenian province of Vierset as the “Vierset Territory” has ignited a firestorm of anti-Belgian sentiment. This is a direct threat to our territorial integrity! If we allow it to go unchallenged then we would be condoning the annexation of our lands and who knows where that might lead? Already the east coast has seen a sharp resurgence of Louisianais nationalism with the small landholders hopeful that the Belgians might aid their cause. This is the beginning of a crisis."
 dvg_belgium.9.a: "Sanacomie has been and always will be Cadien!"

 dvg_belgium.10.t: "The Sanacomie Crisis"
 dvg_belgium.10.d: "The inclusion of Vierset within the unified Belgian nation has infuriated the Plantagenians. By officially confirming our annexation of the province we have given hope to the Louisianais nationalists we have given hope to the Louisianais nationalists."
 dvg_belgium.10.f: "Already several Louisianais groups within Plantagenia have begun agitating for independence and the Planteurs (Plantagenian slaveowning nobles) accuse us of orchestrating them. Furthermore the Plantagenian border has seen a notable increase in military activity. So far no incursions have been made but both Belgian and Plantagenian militias have made public remarks alluding to “foraging missions” which may soon commence. This is a serious matter but both of our nations remember the carnage of the Belgian Revolution and are not eager to repeat it. There may be further buildup before the eruption of this crisis"
 dvg_belgium.10.a: "When it does erupt it, shall echo across Arcadia."
 dvg_belgium.10.b: "The Dutch League convinces the States-General to seek mediation!"

 dvg_belgium.11.t: "A Mediation Conference in Porto Dandolo?"
 dvg_belgium.11.d: "We have received an unexpected offer from the wicked Belgians. The threat of war over Vierset has alarmed them and they wish to attempt a diplomatic resolution to the crisis. They have offered to convene a meeting in the neutral Venetian colony of Athesia at Porto Dandolo to resolve the Sanacomie Crisis without bloodshed."
 dvg_belgium.11.f: "Most are dismissive of this overture viewing it as a mere trick but several wealthy Planteurs are concerned about the loss of profits but several wealthy Planteurs are concerned about the loss of profi – er"
 dvg_belgium.11.a: "Shout the insolent Belgian diplomat out of the foreign office!"
 dvg_belgium.11.b: "This will be interesting."

dvg_belgium_coast_desc: "For far too long, Vryland has been a landlocked country with no coast. With our colonial efforts better enabled, we should take it before anybody else does."
