 dvg_belgium.1.t: "The Seven Republics of New Burgundy"
 dvg_belgium.1.d: "Ever since our independence the “Seven Sisters” have struggled both amongst one another and against our neighbors. The Seven Republics remain aloof from one another, currently only bound by the Articles of Confederation. This document sheltered us through the Plantagenian storm but it has not made us a true nation. "
 dvg_belgium.1.f: "We began as a Burgundian colony conquered by the Dual Monarchy in the 18th century. Plantagenia sought to absorb us into their abominable Arcadian Empire but the glorious Belgian Revolution broke their chains and secured our freedom. For this reason a constitutional convention has been called in Nouvèl Flande where for weeks delegates have been crafting the foundation of a new united nation. Its prospective name is the “Belgian Confederacy” named for the ancient lands of Belgica whose fierce natives warred against the Romans and from which many of our settlers’ ancestors hail from..."
 dvg_belgium.1.a: "Nous le Peuple afin de former une union plus parfaite."

 dvg_belgium.2.t: "The Nouvèl Flande Constitutional Convention"
 dvg_belgium.2.d: "The conference to establish the founding document of the Belgian Confederacy is proceeding at pace. While it is far from finished unification of the Seven Republics currently seems inevitable."
 dvg_belgium.2.f: "As Nouvèl Flandre’s capital city of Nouvelle Bruges has been selected as our new national capital they seem poised to take the lead of our new union."
 dvg_belgium.2.a: "Reject their demand"
 dvg_belgium.2.b: "Surrender control"

 dvg_belgium.3.t: "The Situation in Sanacomie"
 dvg_belgium.3.d: "During our revolution against the Plantagenian menace the brave Louisianais of eastern Plantagenia joined forces with the Seven Republics. However the royalist army was able to reconquer nearly all of Louisiane – only Vierset a town in the Sanacomie region was able to be saved."
 dvg_belgium.3.f: "The upcoming Arcadian Conference arranged by the Old Arcadian League (also known as the Brabantians and the “Roosters”) in Viersetwill attempt to determine a more permanent border between our nations and whether Vierset belongs to our Confederation. While we do not wish to see blood shed over the issue few of our politicians believe that the Plantagenians will negotiate in good faith and there is a widespread expectation that the conference will fail..."
 dvg_belgium.3.a: "We shall try our best regardless."

 dvg_belgium.4.t: "The Arcadian Conference"
 dvg_belgium.4.d: "As expected the conference was a total debacle. The Plantagenians repeatedly accused us of attempting to legitimize our “illegal occupation” of Vierset and refused to even consider abandoning their claim to the province."
 dvg_belgium.4.f: "Moreover, our own delegation was a disorganized jumble of seven politicians – one from each republic – struggling to express a coherent message. They were further divided between the Old Arcadian League the Dutch League (isolationists) and the Burgundian League (expansionists). The Old Arcadians drew criticism as angling to use the Sanacomie issue to claim more power and sell more weapons to the Seven Republics. Barely heard above the din were the Louisianais who were themselves outraged that the Seven Republics had “abandoned” them and were now contemplating returning Vierset to Plantagenia. The conference ended in bitter recrimination and many are blaming the high-handed Old Arcadians for sabotaging the situation and not being more democratic..."
 dvg_belgium.4.a: "We need to stand together against the Plantagenian threat!"
 dvg_belgium.4.b: "Maybe we should send only one delegation next time..."

 dvg_belgium.5.t: "The Tenth Session of the Constitutional Convention"
 dvg_belgium.5.d: "The constitutional convention has been a hopeless back and forth since the end of the war against Plantagenia’s hideous “Arcadian Empire.” It has been paralyzed between the “Three Leagues.” "
 dvg_belgium.5.f: "The Dutch League also known as the “Lions” want a unitary Belgium with a weak president and are isolationists. The Burgundian League or the “Crosses” want a federal Belgium with a strong president who can lead them to victory against the Plantagentians. There is also the fringe Brabantian League also known as the Old Arcadians or the “Roosters” which are a minor faction that espouse pan-Arcadianism. They are small but have rich friends whose appetite for wealth and power has been described as “rivaling Crassus.” They tend to align with the Burgundians but also favor a unitary state. The latest debate is about the central role of the government. The Old Arcadians believe that only a strong Stadtholder can defend Belgium but they have been accused of angling for a dictatorship. Many others want more democratic safeguards."
 dvg_belgium.5.a: "The Old Arcadians are right - we need strength!"
 dvg_belgium.5.b: "The Burgundians persuade the room to uphold liberty"
 dvg_belgium.5.c: "The Calvinists of the Dutch League rally around pacifism."


 dvg_belgium.6.t: "Anti-Cadien Protests!"
 dvg_belgium.6.d: "News of the failure of the Arcadian Conference has stoked the flames of rage against Plantagenia. Cities across the Seven Republics have seen demonstrations calling for war against the south demanding that we liberate the Louisianais from their debased servitude to Nouvelle-France."
 dvg_belgium.6.f: "The largest demonstration of all has been staged in Nouvelle Bruges right outside of the convention! Crowds waved unofficial versions of the proposed Belgian flag along with the banners of the Seven Republics and the old battle standard of the revolutionary Louisianais Republic. Their passionate and irate calls for retribution against the Cadiens have animated many delegates to overcome their hesitation and produce a constitution as soon as possible."
 dvg_belgium.6.a: "War is good for some things it seems..."

 dvg_belgium.7.t: "The Unification of the Belgian Confederacy"
 dvg_belgium.7.d: "Alas, the Belgian republics have united into a single nation."
 dvg_belgium.7.f: "We the People of the Seven Republics in Order to form a more perfect Union establish justice insure domestic tranquility provide for the common defense promote the general welfare and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity do ordain and establish this Constitution for the Confederation of Belgium.” – Preamble to the Belgian Constitution\n\nWhen New Burgundy won its freedom from the Cadien-ruled Arcadian Empire some thought it would shatter and that its republics would go their separate ways. Yet the Seven Sisters have remained under one roof and confirmed the solidarity of their family. The Belgian Constitution has finally been finished and signed and has gone out to the Seven Republics for ratification. While many rejoice at the unification of the Belgian Confederacy our admittance of Vierset as the “Vierset Territory” has provoked outrage in Plantagenia. The newly unified Belgian armed forces may soon undergo a trial by fire."
 dvg_belgium.7.a: "In the name of Belgium, we defy the world!"

dvg_belgium_coast_desc: "For far too long, Vryland has been a landlocked country with no coast. With our colonial efforts better enabled, we should take it before anybody else does."
