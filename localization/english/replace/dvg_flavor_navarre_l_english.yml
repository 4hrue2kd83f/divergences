 dvg_navarre.1.t: "Basque Independence?"
 dvg_navarre.1.d: "Navarra is at the centre of influence conflicts since the Renaissance. Forsaken by the Spanish Crown which pursued its exploration policies, Navarra was both coveted by the king of Aragon and the Anglois Dual Monarchy. Aragon attacked first and invaded Higher-Navarra in 1508. The queen from Navarra fled to her possessions in Aquitaine, Lower-Navarra. Before war erupted, a compromise was found between Aragon and the Dual-Monarchy in Perpignan: The Anglo-French would annex Lower-Navarra while the queen of Navarra would pledge fidelity to the king of Aragon."
 dvg_navarre.1.f: "Over the centuries, the political setup did not change much, with Navarra using its three neighbours against each other to preserve some independence, like with Henri III who took part in the Wars of Religion. But now, Aragon is the shadow of itself, not even considered as a Great Power by many. The king Henry IV thinks he can profit from it, by pulling his Anglo-French and Spanish allies to help him. What will possibly happen?"
 dvg_navarre.1:a: "We will contact the Anglo-French for help!"
 dvg_navarre.1.b: "We will contact the Spanish Crown for help!"
 dvg_navarre.1.c: "We are no vultures. Aragon has our loyalty!"
 dvg_navarre.2.t: "A call from Pampelune..."
 dvg_navarre.2.d: "The king of Navarra has asked us to help him in his dreams of independence. He reasoned that Aragon is decaying and through our historic and cultural ties with the Pamplonan Crown, it is our duty to intervene on his behalf. Yet, our advisors are alarmed: Aragon might be decaying but it is still not dead and might retaliate."
 dvg_navarre.2.f: "Nonetheless, Henry IV awaits an answer. Our strength might be enough to scare off Barcelona, but they nonetheless might escalate it into a war. If we don't help Henry IV, Spain might use this chance alone to finally free the Basque from the Aragonese yoke. But we could use this opportunity to gain a client state in Euskadia, although this would anger our long-time friend and ally Spain."
 dvg_navarre.2.a: "Of course, Navarra should become our puppet!"
 dvg_navarre.2.b: "He must know what his place is, and it is under the Aragonese yoke!"
 dvg_navarre.2.c: "We will support the Spanish claim without directly intervening."
