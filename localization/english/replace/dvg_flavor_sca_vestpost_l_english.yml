 je_vestpost: "Our Presence in Central Africa"
 je_vestpost_reason: "Since the destruction of Protestant Kongo by the Jaga barbarians in the 17th century, our country has struggled to retain its presence on the Central African coast, a vital outpost for trade crossing the Cape to and from our Asian colonies.\n\nThough our allies in the Kingdom of Loango had managed to siege Kinshasa at the turn of the century, the outbreak of the [concept_dvg_german_revolution] prevented us from supporting their claim, and the situation in Central Africa has once again settled into an uneasy status quo."

 dvg_sca_vestpost.1.t: "The Dominion of Vestpost"
 dvg_sca_vestpost.1.d: "Following our conquest of Ndongo, local colonists have petitioned our government for the formation of a 'Dominion of Vestpost', expousing significant autonomy from the Scandinavian crown."
 dvg_sca_vestpost.1.f: "During the decades of conflict between our people and the Jaga invaders, a distinct 'Vestposter' identity emerged among those stationed at Christiansborg. Though its customs and mannerisms are similar to the continental norms, the Vestposters are known for their xenophobic jingoism, agrarian-centered politics, and militant interpretations of Protestantism. Despite many in our cabinet considering this 'dominion' a foolish idea, there are those who argue it is the best means to secure our hold over the region and prevent future Vestposter insurrections."
 dvg_sca_vestpost.1.a: "Vestpost shall become the newest member of the Scandinavian family."
 dvg_sca_vestpost.1.b: "Ridiculous. We will retain direct control over Vestpost."

 dvg_sca_vestpost.2.t: "Plight of the Returned"
 dvg_sca_vestpost.2.d: "After our expulsion from Central Africa, several colonists have hurriedly returned to their former homes in the continent. These so-called 'Vestposters' are already causing a stir in the political scene, arguing in favor of a harsher colonial policy and the militarization of the state."
 dvg_sca_vestpost.2.f: "To many of our citizens, the Vestposters' plight attracts a great deal of sympathy, with harrowing tales being spread of the brutality of the Dark Continent. Among the figureheads of the community is Birger Quisling, a skilled orator and former garrison commander who is known to hold significant sway among prominent figures in our government."
 dvg_sca_vestpost.2.a: "To Africa and back again."
