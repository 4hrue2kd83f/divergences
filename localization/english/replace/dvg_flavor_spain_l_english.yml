 dvg_spain.1.t: "The Revolution of 1808 and its Consequences"
 dvg_spain.1.d: "For centuries, the [concept_dvg_spanish_empire] sustained itself on the exorbitant wealth it extracted from its colonies. This massive undertaking, however, had its costs."
 dvg_spain.1.f: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] developed a culture of conservative aristocracy backstopped by colonial wealth. The kingdom suppressed its domestic bourgeoisie while growing increasingly dependent on manufactured imports from abroad.\n\nIn 1808, the liberal King José II usurped the Spanish throne and attempted to introduce long-overdue liberal reforms at home. The [concept_dvg_dual_monarchy] could not accept this and backed the absolutist pretender Pedro III against José. After winning the brutal [concept_dvg_peninsular_war] in 1815, Pedro reclaimed the throne and issued his own 'Petrine Reforms'. They sharply curtailed colonial trade and reinforced the power of European-born elites, resulting in the collapse of the Mexican colonies.\n\nThe last few decades have not been kind to Spain, and if the increasing furor of Spanish liberals is anything to gauge things by, the next few decades may not be kind, either."
 dvg_spain.1.a: "Viva o Rei, Afonso XV de Lorena-Aviz! Viva Espanha!"
 dvg_spain.2.t: "La Nación Dividida"
 dvg_spain.2.d: "The idea of Spain as a fractured nation is not new. It was felt in the 17th century, when Miguel Cervantes published The Ingenious Gentleman Dom Quixote de los Algarves, the famous story of a mad aristocrat returning to chivalry in a modern world. This well encapsulates the divide of our nation, between liberal and conservative, maritime and terrestrial, modernity and tradition…Spain and Castile. The eastern region of Castile has long chafed under the western centralization which came with the ascent of the Lorena-Aviz dynasty."
 dvg_spain.2.f: "Pedro III moved the capital to Madrid to reconnect with the neglected region, much to the anger of the west, yet even this may not have been enough. The liberals demand a return to Lisbon, and the reactionaries denounce this idea with equal fire and fury. Romantic poets have begun to speak of “Castile” as something unique and rooted in ancient ways. If Spain is to ever see true reform take root, the Castilian question will need to be answered."
 dvg_spain.2.a: "Por uma pequena amostra podemos julgar de toda a peça."
 dvg_spain.3.t: "The Nova Reconquista"
 dvg_spain.3.d: "The radical Jose II usurped the Spanish throne in 1808, and sought to inject mad liberalism into the Spanish colonial system. King Pedro III fought back, with the Dual Monarchy’s help, in the Peninsular War, prevailing in 1815. Pedro then restored absolutism in Spain, promulgating the Petrine Reforms to consolidate the colonial administration. For some reason, this did not satisfy the insolent criollos, who declared a revolutionary Mexican Republic in 1817!"
 dvg_spain.3.f: "While we crushed it, we were not thorough enough. Now, Spanish Arcadia has taken up arms against the Crown under the banner of the Colombian Alliance. Only New Granada and Cuba remain secure. Currently, we are observing an armed truce with the Alliance. Some believe that we should finish the fight and annihilate the rebels, while more cautious ministers argue that it would be more sensible to consolidate our position in New Granada. To resume the war would be to bet the fate of Spain upon victory."
 dvg_spain.3.a: "For God, for King, for Country, destroy Colombia!"
 dvg_spain.3.b: "We must end the carnage and preserve what we have left."
 dvg_spain.4.t: "Disaster on the Horizon"
 dvg_spain.4.d: "With our soldiers still not yet in reach of the Colombian traitors’ bastion of Mexico City, the notorious Guillermo de Blanco is preparing to return to conventional warfare. Emboldened by the continued failure of the Spanish Army to subdue the Colombian Alliance, de Blanco has been rapidly rebuilding support among local New Granadan elites and military officers for an armed uprising."
 dvg_spain.4.f: "It is believed that de Blanco seeks to incite a revolution of his own in New Granada, positioning himself as de Herrera’s successor. If he were to launch such a revolt, the effort required to squash it would require all but abandoning the field of battle to the Colombians. #red It may be wise to accept the loss of New Spain and focus on preventing the loss of New Granada as well.#!"
 dvg_spain.4.a: "We cannot afford to lose both halves of the empire."
 dvg_spain.4.b: "Spain will not bow before some bandit with delusions of grandeur!"
 dvg_spain.5.t: "An Armistice to End All Colombian Wars"
 dvg_spain.5.d: "The War of Colombian Independence has devastated the New World and wreaked havoc upon Spain’s economy and political stability, not to mention the cost in human lives. So much blood has been shed, in fact, that Spain has been driven to accept the loss of the northern half of their New World colonial empire."
 dvg_spain.5.f: "In a diplomatic ceremony in Lisbon, Spain has recognized the independence of the Colombian Alliance. Joyous cries of celebration ring out from Lusitania to Andagoya, but the mood in Spain is one of fear, anxiety, and doubt towards an uncertain future. New Spain has decisively slipped from its old master’s hands."
 dvg_spain.5.a: "All who have served the Crown have plowed the sea…"
 dvg_spain.6.t: "The Nova Reconquista Completed!"
 dvg_spain.6.d: "Alleluia! Once more the Spanish banner flies over the heart of the New World, from Lusitania to Essequibo. The traitors lie vanquished before us, their armies annihilated, and the rebel cities pacified. Anastasio Vicente died fighting during the siege of Mexico City, while notorious New Granadan warlord Guillermo de Blanco and his first lieutenant Antonio Rocafuerte were apprehended in Cartagena while preparing to board an express ship to Etruria, disguised as Catholic monks."
 dvg_spain.6.f: "Rocafuerte, meanwhile, has taken power in the Republic of Cumaná. As the bandit generals lead their people in celebration of their newfound independence, the Spanish find themselves in the depths of an abyss. For the first time since 1519, Spain holds not a single inch of the New World mainland…"
 dvg_spain.6.a: "God willed it, and in His sign we have conquered!"
 dvg_spain.7.t: "The Restoration of New Spain"
 dvg_spain.7.d: "Following our total victory in the New World, the traitorous Columbian Alliance has been dismantled, its leading figures slated for trial for crimes against the Crown. A massive westward migration of bureaucracy and commerce is occurring as the old colonial system has been recreated and the Viceroyalty of New Spain restored. While this is a triumph for Spain, a country whose fortunes had otherwise been flagging as of late, a question has arisen as to whether we should take the opportunity to introduce some new reforms."
 dvg_spain.7.f: "Many have argued against this, saying that our victory in the New World has proven the liberals wrong and demonstrated that absolutism is the supreme form of government. Others, however, have asserted that if we do not seize upon this moment of royal popularity to solve some of the underlying structural problems which precipitated all of this in the first place, there is no reason that this crisis could not happen again in the future."
 dvg_spain.7.a: "I am the State, and I am victorious!"
 dvg_spain.7.b: "Some reforms will help consolidate public trust."
 dvg_spain.8.t: "The Herrerian Independence War"
 dvg_spain.8.d: "Blanco’s revolution has spread like a cancer throughout New Granada. While Rocafuerte has so far failed to incite revolt in the eastern region of New Castille, enough local western elites have been swayed to de Blanco’s cause that he effectively controls half of the colony. He has proven totally unwilling to negotiate, demanding nothing less than unconditional and immediate independence."
 dvg_spain.8.f: "This cannot be permitted! Spain must not be driven from the New World! We shall fight to the bitter end to preserve our power and fight back against the tide of radicalism!"
 dvg_spain.8.a: "Viva o Rey, viva Espanha!"
 dvg_spain.9.t: "Herreria Victorious"
 dvg_spain.9.d: "The unthinkable has occurred : Guillermo de Blanco has triumphed. Spanish forces have been beaten at every turn and forced out of Herreria, and Rocafuerte has finally driven New Castille into joining de Blanco’s revolution. The failure in New Granada has led to the total collapse of the Spanish war effort throughout the New World, as the morale of the military crashes and Spain is forced to retreat to the Caribbean."
 dvg_spain.9.f: "Left with no other options, the King of Spain has swallowed his pride and signed a peace treaty with the revolutionary leaders of the New World – such as de Blanco, the man whom Spain must now admit is the ruler of the sovereign state of Herreria. Rocafuerte, meanwhile, has taken power in the Republic of Cumaná. As the bandit generals lead their people in celebration of their newfound independence, the Spanish find themselves in the depths of an abyss. For the first time since 1519, Spain holds not a single inch of the New World mainland…"
 dvg_spain.9.a: "Meu Deus, meu Deus, por que me abandonaste?"
 dvg_spain.10.t: "The Treaty of Lisbon"
 dvg_spain.10.d: "The unthinkable has occurred : Guillermo de Blanco has triumphed. Though Spain struggled mightily, Spanish forces have suffered a series of particularly disastrous defeats which have totally shattered its armies and sent morale into an unrecoverable dive, as the New Castillians finally abandon Spain and throw their support behind Rocafuerte’s own revolution."
 dvg_spain.10.f: "Left with no other options, the King of Spain has swallowed his pride and signed a peace treaty with the revolutionary leaders of the New World – such as de Blanco, the man whom Spain must now admit is the ruler of the sovereign state of Herreria. Rocafuerte, meanwhile, has taken power in the Republic of Cumaná. As the bandit generals lead their people in celebration of their newfound independence, the Spanish find themselves in the depths of an abyss. For the first time since 1519, Spain holds not a single inch of the New World mainland…"
 dvg_spain.10.a: "Meu Deus, meu Deus, por que me abandonaste?"
 dvg_spain.11.t: "Peace in New Granada"
 dvg_spain.11.d: "Spain and Herreria have fought one another to exhaustion, with neither able to gain a decisive advantage. While Spain was ready to recognize Herreria’s independence in exchange for keeping control of New Granada, it seems that fate had other plans. Towards the close of the conflict, Rocafuerte finally amassed enough support for a revolution of his own. With many elites disillusioned by Spain’s failure to defeat de Blanco, Rocafuerte rode the tide of unrest all the way into the presidency of the revolutionary Republic of Aureliana."
 dvg_spain.11.f: "The failure of the New Granadan front has caused the entire Spanish war effort throughout the New World to disintegrate. Left with no other options, the King of Spain has swallowed his pride and signed a peace treaty with the revolutionary leaders of the New World. As the bandit generals lead their people in celebration of their newfound independence, the Spanish find themselves in the depths of an abyss. For the first time since 1519, Spain is on verge of expulsion from the New World…"
 dvg_spain.11.a: "Meu Deus, meu Deus, por que me abandonaste?"
 dvg_spain.12.t: "Granada Reconquered!"
 dvg_spain.12.d: "For all of de Blanco’s bluster and bravado, he proved to be a far less able military leader than a guerilla commander. Spanish troops, operating out of supply bases in the loyal region of New Castille, crushed the Herrerian rebels in a series of decisive battles, and secured all the major cities in western New Granada. Seeing Herreria’s failure, the Colombians have sued for peace, and we have regained control of New Granada at the expense of surrendering our claim to New Spain."
 dvg_spain.12.f: "De Blanco has been put on a clipper ship back to Spain for trial for treason, and Rocafuerte has fled into exile in Colombia. With New Granada back under rightful Spanish rule, the perseverance of our empire in the New World in at least some form has been assured. The stain of Colombia’s independence, however, will be difficult to erase from our political consciousness."
 dvg_spain.12.a: "At least we may celebrate this victory."
 dvg_spain.13.t: "The Winds of Change"
 dvg_spain.13.d: "The recovery of the Viceroyalty of New Granada, at the expense of New Spain, has sent shockwaves through the Spanish political establishment. Both liberals and conservatives are claiming victory by interpreting the event through different lenses : the former as proof that the Lorena-Aviz dynasty and its allies are a millstone around Spain’s neck, the latter that the Spanish Empire will endure, in one form or another. Perhaps both are right. Public opinion of the Lorena-Avizes is no longer abysmal, but the liberals still feel emboldened in a way not seen since 1808.
 dvg_spain.13.f: "Seizing on the Crown’s moment of weakness, they have raised voices of protest across Spain, demanding the restoration of the Josephine Constitution. Reactionaries within the royal court are aghast at the notion, reminding the king that liberalism was what tore Spain apart during the dark days of the Peninsular War. Perhaps we could grant a revised and shortened version of it as a compromise?"
 dvg_spain.13.a: "We cannot dishonor the men who died for the royal cause!"
 dvg_spain.13.b: "If it is the only way to prevent more fratricide…"
 dvg_spain.14.t: "The Dumbfounded King"
 dvg_spain.14.d: "King Afonso XV had felt reassured when he declared that there would be no restoration of the Josephine Constitution. After all, he told himself, he had resisted the demands of the liberals, and ensured that the memory of all the loyal conservative soldiers who had died in the Peninsula War would not be sullied by his own actions. Alas, it seems that others are not so sensitive to matters of historical memory. Massive protests have erupted across the nation, as liberals take to the streets to demonstrate their outrage towards the king – even Madrid was not spared violent unrest."
 dvg_spain.14.f: "When the King ordered the military to restore order, the generals decided that the time had come for the King to abdicate. After a stern conversation with a roomful of stone-faced officers, King Afonso signed a proclamation announcing his abdication and naming his young son Pedro as his heir, who shall reign as Pedro V. As the regency council announces sweeping democratic reforms, Afonso bids farewell to Madrid and to Spain."
 dvg_spain.14.a: "Well, I’ve always wanted to spend time in Paris…"
 dvg_spain.15.t: "The Lisbon Insurrection"
 dvg_spain.15.d: "The collapse of the Spanish Empire in the New World, after so much blood and treasure had been sacrificed, has been a disaster for the Lorena-Aviz dynasty. Across Spain, liberals are denouncing the king and his court, calling for his immediate abdication. Some radicals have even demanded an end to the monarchy entirely! It is these extremists who have now acted. After several days of unrest in the city of Lisbon, the local military garrison attempted to come to the aid of the municipal government and restore order."
 dvg_spain.15.f: "This operation quickly collapsed, however, as soldiers began to be swayed by the liberals’ rhetoric and a mutiny scythed through their ranks. With soldiers defecting to the radicals, the city was soon overrun. All of Lisbon is now in the hands of these rebels, with famous author and jurist Teófilo Sales acclaimed as Provisional President of their Comitê de Segurança (Security Committee). This may be the burning wick which detonates the Spanish powderkeg."
 dvg_spain.15.a: "This is a catastrophe!"
 dvg_spain.16.t: "The Toledo Junta"
 dvg_spain.16.d: "With Lisbon occupied by militant liberals, a council of Spain’s most prominent military officers led by General Julio Segura has assembled in the city of Toledo. Declaring that the “current national situation” is “inimical to the continuation of the rule of law and public safety,” they have formed an “emergency council” to “protect the nation”."
 dvg_spain.16.f: "While they have ostensibly done this to prevent a radical revolution, many of them have publicly blamed King Afonso XV for not being more diplomatic and provoking this crisis in the first place. #red If the king refuses to work with the junta, they are likely to become his most dangerous enemy.#!"
 dvg_spain.16.a: "Just who or what are they “protecting”?"
 dvg_spain.17.t: "Anarchy Looms"
 dvg_spain.17.d: "The seizure of Lisbon by radical forces, and the declaration of the Toledo junta, has polarized the nation. The royal government is rapidly ceasing to be able to function, as revolutionary sentiment spreads across western Spain, while the military and its conservative allies consolidate their position in the east."
 dvg_spain.17.f: "We find ourselves in the middle, and the situation is grim. Though surrendering to Sales’ revolutionaries is unthinkable, the rhetoric of Segura’s junta is not encouraging, either. The situation is rapidly approaching a point of no return and we are going to have to decide whether to trust the military devil we know or the revolutionary devil we don’t."
 dvg_spain.17.a: "Between Scylla and Charybdis lies Hispania…"
 dvg_spain.18.t: "In the Palace of the King"
 dvg_spain.18.d: "King Afonso XV and his court have run out of time, and must now make a decision on which faction to throw their weight behind. It may still be possible to placate the revolutionaries by reviving the plan of some of the king’s more moderate advisors to revise and reduce the Josephine Constitution and publish the resulting document as a royal charter of rights."
 dvg_spain.18.f: "Doing so might redeem the king in the eyes of more gulli – er, less committed revolutionaries, and allow him to harness the movement against Segura’s junta. He could also do the reverse, issuing a unilateral order to the Junta to head west and destroy the revolution. While this would certainly be the simpler move, and the one which would preserve the most royal power, it rests on the assumption that the junta would not seize the opportunity to accumulate even more power for itself by executing a coup. What is the will of the king?"
 dvg_spain.18.a: "Publishing a royal charter is our only hope – make it so."
 dvg_spain.18.b: "Let’s give this unwashed mob a whiff of grapeshot!"
 dvg_spain.19.t: "The Lisbon Ultimatum"
 dvg_spain.19.d: "The proclamation of the limited royal charter of rights has failed to placate the revolutionaries. A counter-proclamation has recently been issued from Lisbon, the de facto capital of the revolutionary movement, which denounces the document as a “pale substitute of liberty” and “a dishonor to the Spanish people!”"
 dvg_spain.19.f: "Sales’ so-called Comitê de Segurança has presented a demand on behalf of the Spanish revolutionary movement: reinstate the Josephine Constitution, in full and without any alterations, or face a new civil war. Reactionaries within the royal court are outraged at the liberals’ ingratitude, and even some moderate conservatives are angered that they would reject such generosity on behalf of the sovereign. It seems that King Afonso must decide between destroying Spanish royal power or making war upon the west."
 dvg_spain.19.a: "Better a constitutional kingdom than no kingdom at all."
 dvg_spain.19.b: "The army will show these traitors the price of their impudence!"
 dvg_spain.20.t: "A Question of Capitals"
 dvg_spain.20.d: "Now that the threat of civil war has been eliminated, a significant amount of wind has been taken out of the revolutionaries’ sails. Most of western Spain is now returning to law and order – most, but not all. The hardcore radicals have dug in within Lisbon, thought they are now reduced to demanding the return of the national capital to their city. They have made all sorts of arguments as to why this is necessary, which ultimately boil down to their fears of continued conservative domination if the capital remains in the east."
 dvg_spain.20.f: "Many conservatives have reacted with scorn to this proposal, sharply rebuking the liberals for daring to continue to make demands upon the sovereign after he has already graciously permitted such massive reforms. This may very well be the last significant decision which King Afonso personally makes in his capacity as head of state. Shall the capital return to Lisbon?"
 dvg_spain.20.a: "No, why would we give the traitors another reward?"
 dvg_spain.20.b: "Yes, it will simplify matters in the long run."
 dvg_spain.21.t: "The Lisbon Massacre"
 dvg_spain.21.d: "When General Segura and the rest of the Toledo Junta learned of the liberals’ intransigence regarding the capital, even after the king had restored the Josephine Constitution, they decided to finally take action to root out the would-be revolutionaries. Marshaling their forces, they descended upon the city determined to destroy the radicals – and destroy they did."
 dvg_spain.21.f: "Hundreds of people were shot down in the streets, with the liberals totally outgunned by the army. Sales himself was tried by a military tribunal, convicted, and hanged in front of the Cathedral of Saint Mary Major. Lisbon has been recaptured, but the death toll is staggering. Many wonder if this blood-soaked affair is a sign of things to come in Spain’s fragile new democracy."
 dvg_spain.21.a: "An inauspicious beginning, to be sure…"
 dvg_spain.22.t: "The Coup of [TimeKeeper.GetCurrentDate.GetString]"
 dvg_spain.22.d: "When King Afonso ordered Segura to take decisive action against the revolutionaries, he obeyed – in a way. Decisive action was taken, but not against the revolutionaries. Instead, the junta concluded that the greatest danger to Spain was not the rebels in Lisbon, but King Afonso himself. Thus, they marched north to Madrid, their forces easily overwhelming the city garrison and reaching the royal palace. There they explained to Afonso that he and the rest of the royal family were to immediately abdicate and depart for the Dual Monarchy."
 dvg_spain.22.f: "Afonso attempted to protest, but the generals made it clear that they blamed him and his intransigence for creating the crisis and warned him that many revolutionaries would be angered at the notion of the Lorena-Avizes leaving Spain alive. By ensuring his family’s safe exile, they were already being quite merciful. King Afonso had no choice but to sign a pronouncement declaring his abdication, handing power over to the junta."
 dvg_spain.22.a: "What shall they do with their newfound power?"
 dvg_spain.23.t: "The Spanish Revolution"
 dvg_spain.23.d: "When the Toledo Junta forced King Afonso to abdicate, many feared that Segura would seize all power for himself and ignite a war with the revolutionaries in the west. These pessimists were astonished when, instead, the Junta proclaimed its “investment and entrusting of all sovereign power” in the Lisbon rebels!"
 dvg_spain.23.f: "The Comitê de Segurança quickly convened an assembly of representatives to establish a new government. What emerged from this legal crucible was nothing less than a republic – a constitutional, democratic republic, the likes of which have not been seen since the tumult which preceded the Great German Wars. Crowned heads across Europe feel the growing shadow of an enemy they thought long dead, as republicanism rises from the ashes. A revolution has been carried out at the edge of Europe, but surely its influence shall soon be made manifest across the continent – including the energizing of its enemies."
 dvg_spain.23.a: "Like the sun upon the sky, we greet the rising of the Republic!"
 dvg_spain.24.t: "The Matter of the Fueros"
 dvg_spain.24.d: "For centuries, Castile and other parts of Spain have enjoyed a complex system of separate legal codes under the name of the “fueros.” When the Lorena-Aviz dynasty began to centralize more and more power towards the western coast of Spain, particularly around Lisbon, the fueros allowed the Castilians to resist their efforts and force the kings of Spain to accommodate to local realities. This system was brought crashing to the ground by King José II, who issued the Lisbon Proclamation in 1809 which destroyed the fueros in the name of modernizing Spanish law and administration."
 dvg_spain.24.f: "However, the victory of the Pedristas in the Peninsular War restored the fueros, and the Castilians have been using them to resist our attempts to centralize Spain. Our government is now considering whether to revive the Lisbon Proclamation and attempt once more to dismantle the fueros. Doing so would be a tremendous victory over the backwards, feudal nature of Spanish law, but would also outrage the Castilians."
 dvg_spain.24.a: "We must tear down this whole rotten system!"
 dvg_spain.24.b: "Abolition would be far too dangerous at this time."
 dvg_spain.25.t: "Spaniards in Paris"
 dvg_spain.25.d: "Our fair capital is no stranger to famous guests, but the new arrivals shocked even the most jaded Parisians: King Afonso XV of Spain, and most of the Lorena-Aviz royal family! He has quickly contacted the royal court, where we have learned the details of his overthrow. Afonso was quick to blame a sinister conspiracy between liberal extremists and traitorous army officers, who have now joined forces to seize Spain and proclaim a republic!"
 dvg_spain.25.f: "Anglois reactionaries are apoplectic over the affair : Spain was one of our closest allies, not to mention a shining bastion of the Catholic faith. Its loss to the republican menace is a bitter blow to all of Europe. Now, many conservatives are demanding that we intervene in Spain to overthrow the liberals and reinstall Afonso, like our liberation of Spain from José II in the Peninsular War of 1808-1815. Of course, launching such a colossal war would destabilize Europe even further, and might invite our enemies to aid the Spanish Republic."
 dvg_spain.25.a: "We shall destroy the revolution and save Spain like our forefathers!"
 dvg_spain.25.b: "A major European war would be horrendous, recognize the Republic."
 dvg_spain.26.t: "The Second Peninsular War"
 dvg_spain.26.d: "For the second time in decades, the Dual Monarchy has declared war upon Spain, ostensibly its ally. It has done so as it did in 1808 : to destroy Spanish liberalism and restore a conservative to the throne. That they are doing so now to restore the recently ousted king, Afonso XV, rather than a mere pretender, matters little to the Spanish people. They are now bracing for yet more carnage, with General Segura and the dashing young Major-General Francisco Aguirre leading Spain into battle."
 dvg_spain.26.f: "Yet while the Spanish people once fought in the name of a king of their own, now they are doing so for new reasons. If you asked the more intellectual among them, they would speak of liberalism, republicanism, democracy, and the consent of the governed. They would speak of the ways in which the Lorena-Aviz dynasty has mired Spain in backwardness and repression, and how the Anglois have acted in concert with them. However, for the common Spanish citizen, the reason to fight is summed up in a single phrase."
 dvg_spain.26.a: "Não passaram!"
 dvg_spain.27.t: "Navarre Defies Us!"
 dvg_spain.27.d: "As part of our war effort against the illegitimate Spanish Republic, we had sent an envoy to Navarre to confirm that Anglois land and naval forces would be allowed passage through the country en route to Spain. This was expected to be a simple matter of transit, but it seems that the Navarrese have taken the opportunity to make some sort of absurd stand. Denouncing us as an “aggressive menace,” the Navarrese have refused to give our military passage!"
 dvg_spain.27.f: "While much of the Anglois military is outraged by this affront, some members of the royal court have brought up the topic of the Plantagenets’ old claims to Navarre. This incident could give us the opportunity to “remind” the Navarrese of our claim, threatening to occupy and annex them if they do not obey us. #red We should be cognizant that our neighbors, particularly Aragon, would be alarmed at such an ultimatum, and may take action to prevent us from conquering Navarre.#!"
 dvg_spain.27.a: "We will not be bullied by a speck upon the map!"
 dvg_spain.27.b: "The mightiest nation in the world is above such pettiness."
 dvg_spain.28.t: "The Republic Triumphant"
 dvg_spain.28.d: "Victory is ours! The Spanish Republic has endured the savage Anglois’ attempt to foist the Lorena-Aviz back onto the Spanish throne, and the Plantagenets have been publicly humiliated by their failure. Outplanned by the wise General Segurra, and outfoxed by the clever Major-General Aguirre, they have been forced to recognize our government and disavow the Lorena-Avizes. The world, which was shocked by our rise, has now been astonished by our prevailing over the Anglois menace : liberals throughout the world shall surely be inspired by our mighty example."
 dvg_spain.28.f: "The republic’s victory has won the trust of many Spaniards, who are now cautiously willing to have faith in Spain’s new democratic experiment. The monarchist cause lies in ruins as liberalism continues to advance, leading Spain into modernity. Perhaps the blood which we have spilled together as one people shall consecrate our efforts to reforge Spain into a free and united nation."
 dvg_spain.28.a: "Like Athens against Persia, democracy has defeated tyranny!"
 dvg_spain.29.t: "L’humiliation"
 dvg_spain.29.d: "To the confoundment of the entire Anglois military, we have failed in our efforts to cast down the Spanish Republic. Due to our inability to defeat the liberal menace, the Lisbon regime has forced us to the negotiating table. In the resulting peace treaty, we have been forced to recognize them as the legitimate successors to the Kingdom of Spain, and publicly disavow Afonso and the rest of the Lorena-Aviz dynasty."
 dvg_spain.29.f: "The Lorena-Avizes are already preparing to leave for Plantagenia, but for us there can be no flight into exile to flee from our failures. There is only an uncertain future, with a liberal republic at our doorstep…and its wretched example giving inspiration to legions of traitors and separatists in both England and Occitania."
 dvg_spain.29.a: "Merde!"
 dvg_spain.30.t: "A Catástrofe"
 dvg_spain.30.d: "The republican dream has perished beneath the onslaught of Anglois shot and cannonade. The wicked alliance of Anglois and Spanish monarchists scythed through the countryside, butchering all who resisted them, before descending with rapine and slaughter upon Lisbon, brutally sacking the city. General Segurra was merely forced into retirement, but Major-General Aguirre was executed by the Anglois."
 dvg_spain.30.f: "Throughout the nation, anyone remotely associated with anti-republicanism has taken the opportunity to settle personal scores against any liberal, knowing that the occupiers would shield them. The result has been a cascade of violence and internecine warfare, as village after village attempts to purge itself of the “traitors” in its midst. The Dual Monarchy cares not for the carnage they have caused, only for the treaty by which the war was ended. Said treaty placed Afonso back on the throne and confirmed the fueros, while transferring multiple colonies to Anglois rule as payment for their efforts."
 dvg_spain.30.a: "Os fortes fazem o que querem e os fracos sofrem o que devem."
 dvg_spain.31.t: "The Dual Monarchy Pursues Diplomacy"
 dvg_spain.31.d: "In order to prevent a conservative uprising, which may have occurred had King Afonso and the Lorena-Aviz family been executed (as some radicals wished), the Toledo Junta instead allowed them to go into exile in the Dual Monarchy. Many liberals feared that this would lead the Dual Monarchy to attempt to restore Afonso to the Spanish throne."
 dvg_spain.31.f: "Thankfully, this has not occurred. An Anglois diplomatic envoy arrived in Lisbon today, bearing official documents which recognized the Spanish Republic as the legitimate successor to the Kingdom of Spain, and which formally opened diplomatic relations between our governments. It seems as though the “Anglois Menace,” so hated by radical republicans, will leave us be for now."
 dvg_spain.31.a: "The Anglois lion sleeps tonight."
 dvg_spain.32.t: "The Future of Spain"
 dvg_spain.32.d: "In one way or another, Spain has been reunified – in theory. The aversion of civil war has only been the first step in the journey towards national healing. What is needed now is a comprehensive review of Spanish society, and the government’s role within it."
 dvg_spain.32.f: "Politicians and writers across the nation have begun fighting battles of words and ideas, each seeking to advance their own plans for the revival of Spanish fortunes. Whichever set of voices win out and make themselves heard above the din shall decide the fate of Spain."
 dvg_spain.32.a: "À frente!"
 dvg_spain.33.t: "The Decline and Fall of the Madrid Economy"
 dvg_spain.33.d: "With Lisbon’s reinstatement as the Spanish capital, Madrid has seen its prospects plummet. Less than a century ago, Madrid was little more than a royal hunting lodge, an appendage of Toledo. It was only Pedro III’s efforts to move the capital eastwards and reject the coastal establishment, and the necessary reorienting of the bureaucracy, which drew any sort of prosperity to Madrid. Now that even this is gone, the city has suffered an abrupt economic decline. Every day, more people are leaving the city for good, moving to Lisbon or some other, more prominent city."
 dvg_spain.33.f: "Shops are closing by the dozen, merchants are deserting the city, and nearly all manifestations of foreign capital are vanishing. For those who remain – the Castilians who have called Madrid home for centuries – the sharp pain of the economic loss only compounds their bitterness, and their sense of being used by the uncaring elite of the coast. Some Castilians have even called for the easterners to “reclaim” Madrid as their own symbol."
 dvg_spain.33.a: "I never liked Madrid much, anyway."
