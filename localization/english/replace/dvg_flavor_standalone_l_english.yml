 dvg_standalone_flavour.1.d: "Scottish-Scandinavian zoologist, Henry Barclays has visited the north of Angkor, discovering a new species of deer!"
 dvg_standalone_flavour.1.f: ""I was standing on the bank of a river some hours from Stung Treng, far north of Phnom Penh. There I saw the stag, he stood and stared at me, his antler's the shape of a lyre and brown fur shimmering, far whiter than any stag I had seen on my many adventures to the Highlands. I began to sketch him immediately, however he turned away only a moment later, I named it after my father who I loved dearly; Walter Barclays.""
 dvg_standalone_flavour.1.a: "What a magnificent creature!"
