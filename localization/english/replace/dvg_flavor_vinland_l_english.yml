 #Vinland primer
 dvg_vinland.1.t: "The Crown Colony of Vinland"
 dvg_vinland.1.d: "In the power vacuum of the Burgundian-Geuzen Wars, a new republic was established to the north of the Cape."
 dvg_vinland.1.f: "Be servants and you will be deservedly scorned but fight to be citizens and you will be rightfully strengthened.・ ・ Emil Krag leader of the Rebellion of 1827\n\nNo colony is as dear to Scandinavia as Vinland. First briefly settled by the Norse modern Scandinavian settlement began in the early 1600s. Scandinavians (many from Norway) and Finns tended to obtain colonial charters for the north Germans and Scots for the south. The Scandinavian crown embraced this bifurcation by creating the colonies of Vinland and Masgirland. Plantagenia invaded Vinland in 1799 and while they were defeated the traumatic experienced sharpened Vinlandic views that Scandinavia was not a reliable protector. The Rebellion of 1827 was sparked due to bitterness about local corruption and lack of representation or self-rule led by the politician Emil Krag. The revolt was crushed but both colonies have been under military occupation ever since. A single spark could light the fire anew."
 dvg_vinland.1.a: "Vinland, we stand on guard for thee!"

 #Masgirland Primer
 dvg_vinland.2.t: "The Crown Colony of Masgirland"
 dvg_vinland.2.d: "Masgirland, while settled at the same time as Vinland has developed a separate identity mainly due to the difference in its colonization."
 dvg_vinland.2.f: "Unlike Vinland it was mainly settled by the Germans and the Scottish. The situation in Masgirland is further complicated due to its economy. Much of the colony is reliant upon fishing and thus upon European export markets. This has led Masgirlanders to ironically, see themselves as closer to the Scandinavian colonial authorities than the mostly Nordic Vinlanders who are much more militant about independence and republicanism. While Masgirland has its own discontents about lack of representation within Scandinavia should Vinland make another bid for freedomMasgirlanders may struggle to choose a side."
 dvg_vinland.2.b: "The small protected by the Great."

 #Skrealings Primer
 dvg_vinland.3.t: "The Skraeling Territory"
 dvg_vinland.3.d: "Nestled in the heart of Arcadia lies an indigenous-led territory."
 dvg_vinland.3.f: "For many European settlers, the Great Lakes is a barbarian region where civilization has yet to spread. For philosophers this is a Garden of Eden where noble savages thrive. For Scandinavia this is their most remote colony. For most of the local tribes - the hundreds of Algonquin and Iroquois nations that inhabit the region and who answer to the Scandinavian governor - the so-called Skr・ling Council allows them to live in relative peace. But as Vinlanders ask for independence while the Plantagenians and Belgians eye the border territories the differences between the Algonquins and the Iroquois are thrown into sharp relief. Europeans may have lumped them together but they are not one people not yet at least. Soon they will once again march to war but will it be against each other or against the settlers?"
 dvg_vinland.3.a: "There's not one big Skraeling tribe?"

 #Olaf Larsson
 dvg_vinland.4.t: "The Rebellion of 1837"
 dvg_vinland.4.d: "Nestled in the heart of Arcadia lies an indigenous-led territory."
 dvg_vinland.4.f: "Olaf Larsson, a Vinlandic fur trader of minor renown has been dissatisfied with the steep Scandinavian tariffs which have greatly cut into his business and has radicalized into a militant republican. Hoping to ignite a popular revolution against Scandinavian rule he and a small group of sympathizers held a meeting in which they declared the ・Vinlandic Republic・ with Larsson as provisional president. This ・Executive Council of Vinland・ then seized a printing press and began printing announcements of the ・creation of the Vinlandic Republic・ and exhorting the people to rise. Larsson and company rode across the area distributing them to whoever they found and goading several mobs to attack Scandinavian patrols. Ultimately however, many people were more amused or confused by their efforts than inspired and the ・Executive Council・ was apprehended by the authorities days after the incident began. However Larsson・s propaganda is still circulating within the colony..."
 dvg_vinland.4.a: "Just another rabble rouser."

 dvg_vinland.5.t: "The Rebellion of 1839"
 dvg_vinland.5.d: "Yet another rebellion has struck Vinland."
 dvg_vinland.5.f: "Larsson's rebellion of two years ago was a mere farce, but the radical liberal literature which he distributed has imbued new emotional vibrancy into the VInlandic independence movement. One group which has seen a revival of its fortunes is the Samfunn af Patrioter (Society of Patriots) a secret independence society led by politician Kresten S・ndergaard. A small fight in Erikshavn between the Patrioter and several members of the Leifssonklub cladestine loyalists, soon led to arrest warrants being issued for multiple Patrioter. The Patrioter instead decided to resist arrest soon led to arrest warrants being issued for multiple Patrioter. The Patrioter instead decided to resist arrest summoning hundreds of members into the countryside to protect the fleeing fugitives. After fending off several Scando-Vinlandic search parties and beginning to snowball in strength and numbers the Patrioter militia was finally defeated near the frontier of the Belgian Confederacy. We were surprised to learn that S・ndergaard himself had been leading the rebels! He is now in custody and will soon stand trial for treason and insurrection."
 dvg_vinland.5.a: "We already got a necktie for him."

 dvg_vinland.6.t: "Sondergaard Escapes"
 dvg_vinland.6.d: "Despite the Patrioter's theatrics, the trial was fairly straightforward."
 dvg_vinland.6.f: "The evidence against him was considerable and despite several eloquent speeches from the defendant his guilt fairly obvious. Condemned to death, he was held under armed guard in Elvemunning Prison in Erikshavn` before being transported to the town square for public execution. As the transport was passing beneath a bridge however, a single Patriot dashed into the road and aimed a pistol at the driver ordering him to stop! Simultaneously a large group of Patriot men leapt over a nearby wall rushed the vehicle and forced open the doors. S・ndergaard was quickly freed before the mob dispersed in advance of Scandinavian reinforcements. Despite an ongoing manhunt Sondergaard has yet to be found..."
 dvg_vinland.6.a: "Can't Vinlanders do anything right?"


 dvg_vinland.7.t: "Martyrdom of Sondergaard"
 dvg_vinland.7.d: "Despite the Patrioter's theatrics, the trial was fairly straightforward."
 dvg_vinland.7.f: "With news of Sondergaard's escape, it was thought that he wouldn・t be able to hide for long. Thus the Vinlandic government was frustrated at the lack of the search・s progress ・ until a certain horrid tale reached them. Apparently S・ndergaard had been captured by a patrol near the Belgian border about a week ago. Rather than report his capture the patrol ・ several of whom had family members who were killed by Patrioter in 1827 and 1839 ・ decided to enact their own revenge. For weeks, Sondergaard was tortured in the basement of an abandoned hunting lodge, eventually dying of his wounds. Although the Vinlandic governor demanded that this remain secret information has a way of leaking out. A fortnight later the newspaper headlines scream of ・THE AGONY OF SONDERGAARD.・ Slowly, people who read the ghastly tale and had never been all that political before, begin to discover within themselves a love of liberty and a hatred of the Scandinavian Crown and the blood-soaked regime that it is propping up..."
 dvg_vinland.7.a: "His soul is marching on!"
 dvg_vinland.7.b: "This fad will go away."


 dvg_vinland.8.t: "Martyrdom of Sondergaard"
 dvg_vinland.8.d: "Despite the Patrioter's theatrics, the trial was fairly straightforward."
 dvg_vinland.8.f: "With news of Sondergaard's escape, it was thought that he wouldn・t be able to hide for long.

 dvg_vinland.8.a: "His soul is marching on!"

 dvg_vinland.9.t: "The Vinlandic Revolution"
 dvg_vinland.9.d: "The recent loss of Scandinavian control in Arcadia has breathed new life into the nationalist Samfunn af Patrioter. Reorganized under the leadership of liberal firebrand Johan Nielsson."
 dvg_vinland.9.f: "The Patrioter had formed republican cells in cities across Vinland, recruiting members of both the military and the civilian Vinlandic government into their ranks. Each cell then organized a militia to be called upon when the time came. That time came about four days ago when a Scandinavian unit attempted to arrest a Patrioter cell within the Kusbole militia and their comrades came out to defend them. The standoff soon became a battle one which signaled the initiation of a full-scale Patrioter uprising. Vinlandic officers and politicians began defecting to the Patrioters as news of the rebellion spread and with Scandinavia unable to contain the rebellion it even spread into Masgirland. Both colonies・ capitals have been seized and the banners of liberal democracy lifted high above Arcadia."
 dvg_vinland.9.a: "Frihet"
