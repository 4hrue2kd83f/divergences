 dvg_bavaria.1.t: "The Electorate of Bavaria"
 dvg_bavaria.1.d: "Bavaria in recent years has become the envy of the various states of the Holy Roman Empire : It remains the only true victor of the Great German Wars, evident by the lack of large-scale destruction of the electorate and its expansion to include the former Princely County of Tyrol in 1814 among other territories, confirmed in the Congress of Paris of 1820. Guided by two popular dukes in a row, namely Duke Maximilian "Max" IV "the Great" von Wittelsbach, whose exceptionally long reign between 1798 and 1832 was marked by the ascendancy of Bavaria in the Danubian Circle, and his only surviving son William "Willy" IV, who is ruling Bavaria since 1832. Bavaria is still defining its ambitions in Germany and its future is unclear : The impotence of His Serene Highness the Duke-Elector is an open secret, though his young age of only 31 gives him plenty of time to shape the destiny of Bavaria. That is, of course, unless the vast array of political leaders and ideologues which the electorate of Bavaria houses force him into another direction."
